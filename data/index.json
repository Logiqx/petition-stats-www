                    "details": "The UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances. We must respect the referendum result.\r\n\r\nProrogation is a prerogative Act of the Crown, exercised on the advice of Ministers, to bring about the end of the parliamentary session. The royal prerogative is the term used to describe the powers held by Government Ministers, either in their own right, or through the advice they provide to the Queen which she is bound constitutionally to follow. The Government determines the length of a parliamentary session and advises the Queen on the date for the beginning of the next parliamentary session.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the next session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament during which the Queen delivers the Queen\u2019s Speech. The Queen\u2019s Speech sets out the programme of legislation the Government intends to pursue in the forthcoming parliamentary session.\r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister said in his statement on 2 September 2019, the Government has committed to recruiting another 20,000 police officers, improving both NHS and schools funding, and completing 20 new hospital upgrades. It is to progress the Government\u2019s agenda on these and many other fronts that the Prime Minister has sought to commence a new session of Parliament in October.\r\n\r\nParliament is only dissolved before a General Election. Dissolution brings an end to a Parliament. The effect of a dissolution is all business comes to an end and every seat in the House of Commons is vacated until a General Election is held.\r\n \r\nUnder the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, General Elections are now automatically held every five years and the next general election is scheduled for May 2022. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act removed the prerogative power to dissolve Parliament; no longer can the Prime Minister advise the sovereign to dissolve Parliament and call a General Election.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act also provides the basis on which an early General Election can be triggered:\r\n\r\n1. If a motion for an early general election is agreed either by at least two-thirds of the whole House of Commons or without a vote; or\r\n\r\n2. If a motion of \u2018no confidence\u2019, in the terms set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, is passed and no subsequent motion expressing confidence in Her Majesty\u2019s Government is passed by the Commons within 14 days.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an early-general election, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act allows the Prime Minister to recommend a suitable polling day to the Queen. There will be a Royal Proclamation to set the date. Parliament is then automatically dissolved 25 working days before polling day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government would prefer to leave the EU with a deal and will work in an energetic and determined way to get a better deal. The Government is very willing to sit down with the Commission and EU Member States to talk about what needs to be done to achieve that.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has said an election needs to take place ahead of the European Council on 17 to 18 October. This would allow the Prime Minister to go to the European Council with a clear mandate from the British people to deliver the referendum result.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office",

                    "details": "Air ambulance services are not NHS funded and are provided by 18 charitable organisations across England, with the majority of their resources supported by their own fundraising activities.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that Air Ambulances provide a valuable service, including to remote locations through both delivery of a specialist team to an incident, and patient transportation back to treatment centres. Air Ambulance crews treat people in critical conditions who rely on urgent treatment before they can reach a hospital. They support the wider NHS emergency response on the ground, ensuring patients get specialised care in both urban settings and hard-to-reach rural areas.   \r\n\r\nMany Ambulance Trusts across England currently work in partnership with Air Ambulance providers from the commercial and charity sectors to deliver services. NHS England works closely with Air Ambulance charities at a local level as part of their considerations of the urgent and emergency care mix in different areas of the country. The NHS Long Term Plan will improve emergency care for all patients, including those treated by Air Ambulances charities.\r\n\r\nSince April 2002, the NHS has been instructed to provide and fund the cost of some staff on a number of Air Ambulances. However, as decisions on the provision of services for the safe delivery of care are best made at a local level, the level of funding support varies from charity to charity; some charities fully fund their own medical staff on their ambulance, whilst others receive more NHS funding support. Both the type of service provided, and the level of funding support will be driven by local issues such as geography and demography. There are high capital and revenue costs associated with helicopter emergency medical services, including purchasing and maintaining helicopter provision. \r\n\r\nHowever, we have made provisions for substantial funding support in this and previous budgets to help ensure that Air Ambulance charities are equipped to provide lifesaving care to patients in need. This year, Air Ambulance charities across England have been invited to bid for a share of \u00a310 million capital funding to invest in new equipment and upgrade facilities to support them in delivering services to patients across England.\r\n\r\nThe All-Party Parliamentary Group for Air Ambulances (APPGAA) is a group of MPs and peers dedicated to highlighting issues and opportunities around Air Ambulance services with policy makers. We will continue to work closely with the sector to ensure patients continue to benefit from these services. Essential public donations, combined with periodic funding contributions from the Government, will ensure these charities can have world-class facilities to match their reputation for world-class care, through a patient-centred approach which works for the population they serve.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care.",

Much of this abuse happens on social media, and the Government is aware of too many stories of public figures closing social media accounts following online abuse. In many cases, the offender will be unknown to the victim, and in some instances, they will have taken technical steps to conceal their identity.\r\n\r\nThis abuse is unacceptable \u2013 it goes beyond free speech and free debate, dissuades good people from going into public life, and corrodes the values on which our democracy rests. \r\n\r\nThe Online Harms White Paper sets out our intent to establish in law a new duty of care on companies towards their users, overseen by an independent regulator. Companies will be required to build an understanding of the risks associated with their services and take reasonable steps to guard against harm to their users, relative to their level of risk and resources. Companies need to take responsibility for tackling abusive behaviour on their services, because our society is built on democratic freedoms that allow different voices, views and opinions to freely and peacefully contribute to public discourse. \r\n\r\nDetails of the reasonable steps we expect companies to take will be set out in codes of practice which will be issued by the regulator. But specifying a particular technical solution risks that approach becoming outdated or defunct as technology and harms evolve. \r\n\r\nAhead of the implementation of the new regulatory framework, we will continue to encourage companies to take early action to address online harms.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.",

However, key to tackling these issues is to work with Brazil to find solutions rather than imposing sanctions. \r\n\r\nDeforestation is an issue the United Kingdom has been dedicated to addressing in partnership with Brazil for a long time. Since 2012, the United Kingdom has invested nearly \u00a3120 million in a number of International Climate Finance programmes. These programmes help to tackle deforestation, and support Brazil\u2019s rural communities, farmers and businesses to produce food and adopt sustainable agricultural practices that prevent forest fires, protect natural habitats and improve livelihoods.\r\n\r\nIn response to the recent forest fires, the Prime Minister pledged a further \u00a310 million at the G7 summit on 25 August. This contribution is an expansion of an existing project: Partnerships for Forests. The funding will increase the programme\u2019s support for the protection and restoration of Brazil\u2019s rainforests, including areas impacted by the recent fires. Brazil, in response to international pressure, has launched an unprecedented operation to combat the fires, deploying 43,000 military staff. \r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom firmly believes climate change is one of the most important global issues and international cooperation is vital. Brazil is an important partner in this endeavour and has a critical role to play - we must work with them to find solutions.  We have an ongoing dialogue with Brazil on these issues at both ministerial and official level.  \r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom will continue to monitor the situation in the Amazon closely and raise these critical issues in our dialogue with Brazil. The Government remains committed to supporting efforts to tackle deforestation in the Amazon through our bilateral programmes.\r\n\r\nForeign & Commonwealth Office.",

                    "details": "This is a devolved matter. Defra is working with key interested parties to ensure the sustainable management of the uplands, balancing environmental and economic benefits, which includes the role of sustainable grouse shooting. \r\n\r\nThe Government appreciates that many people hold strong views on the issue of driven grouse shooting. The Government considers that shooting activities bring many benefits to the rural economy and can in many cases be beneficial for wildlife and habitat conservation. We recognise that it is vital that wildlife and habitats are respected and protected and the law is respected. We will continue work to ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation. The Government has no plans to ban grouse shooting. \r\n \r\nWild birds and other wild animals are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. We have identified raptor persecution as a wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group (RPPDG) focuses on the golden eagle, goshawk, hen harrier, peregrine, red kite and white-tailed eagle. The group is working on developing tools to help tackle raptor persecution crimes.\r\n\r\nThe National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, monitors and gathers intelligence on illegal activities affecting raptors and assists police forces when required. Despite instances of poisoning and killing of birds of prey, populations of many species, such as the peregrine falcon, red kite and buzzard have increased. We are concerned that with respect to eliminating illegal bird of prey persecution, there are still individuals who continue to commit these crimes. We will work with all stakeholders to try to eradicate these crimes. Any evidence of crime should be presented to the local police force for their consideration. \r\n\r\nGrouse shooting takes place in upland areas, which are important for delivering a range of valuable ecosystem services, including food, fibre, water regulation, carbon storage, biodiversity and recreational opportunities. UK uplands have 75% of the world\u2019s remaining heather moorland and about 13% of the world\u2019s blanket bog. \r\n\r\nSeventy per cent of the UK\u2019s drinking water is provided from upland catchments. The Government is committed to delivering positive environmental and economic benefits and creating a more sustainable future for the English uplands, including preserving and restoring peatlands through development of the UK Peatland Code; there is also funding of peatland restoration through Government-funded grants and private sector sponsorship.  We will publish an England Peat Strategy later this year, setting out our vision for how our precious peatlands will be restored and protected.\r\n\r\nHealthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. Natural England is working with landowners of grouse moors to develop management agreements, which include vegetation management principles for the various habitats on grouse moors. These agreements aim to reverse habitat degradation and help landowners sustainably manage and restore upland peatland habitats. The Government encourages land managers to work closely with Natural England to put agreements in place for all the benefits they bring to moor owners and to the environment. The Government is working with moor owners and stakeholders to improve management practices and peat condition further through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nA report by the UK shooting community (Public & Corporate Economic Consultants report 2014: The Value of Shooting) concludes that the overall impact of game bird shooting is positive; the industry has estimated that \u00a3250 million per year is spent on management activities substantially benefiting conservation. The Moorland Association highlights that estates in England and Wales spent \u00a352.5 million on managing 149 grouse moors for shooting in 2010. The industry supports 1,520 full time equivalent jobs and is worth \u00a397.7 million across Great Britain. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.",

Sentencing should always match the severity of the crime. We understand the devastating impact knife crime has on victims and their families, and are determined to put a stop to violent crimes that involve knives.\r\n\r\nParliament has provided sentencing rules to give courts the powers they need to effectively deal with the range of offences and offenders which come before them. Where someone is actually harmed by a knife or offensive weapon, there are a range of offences that the person may be charged with, such as causing grievous bodily harm. These can result in lengthy sentences up to life imprisonment. In England and Wales in fact, all murder convictions must result in a life sentence. For offenders aged 18 and over who bring a knife or another weapon to the scene of a murder with the intention of using it, courts will consider a minimum term spent in custody of at least 25 years.\r\n\r\nWhere adult offenders were cautioned or convicted of possessing a knife or offensive weapon for the first time in the year to March 2019, over half (55%) received some form of custodial sentence.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, we introduced minimum custodial sentences for repeat knife possession and offences that involve threatening with a weapon. Adults face a minimum of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment whilst young people aged 16 or 17 face a minimum 4-month Detention and Training Order. Since the introduction of the minimum custodial term people caught carrying a knife or offensive weapon for a second time are now more likely than ever before to go to prison \u2013 in the year ending March 2019, 83% of offenders received a custodial sentence for repeat possession offences.\r\n\r\nWhen sentencing, the courts consider the full circumstances of the offence and offender and must follow any relevant sentencing guidelines produced by the independent Sentencing Council. The guidelines are clear that for any offence the use of a weapon will be treated as an aggravating factor meriting an increased sentence. \r\n\r\nIt is clear tackling serious violence requires a response on several fronts. This Government is clear knife crime must be tackled and 20,000 new police officers are being recruited as part of  ongoing work to tackle serious violence. \r\n\r\nKnife Crime Prevention Orders have been introduced through the Offensive Weapons Act 2019. These new laws are an additional tool police will be able to use to work with young people and adults to help steer them away from knife crime and serious violence. Breaching an order can result in up to two years in prison.\r\n\r\nThe Government has also announced a fund of \u00a3100m to tackle serious violence which is being made available this year. \u00a363.4m of this was made available for police surge activity to forces worst affected by serious violence and the Home Office recently announced the allocation of \u00a335m for the creation of Violence Reduction Units in 18 local areas. Violence Reduction Units bring together police, local government, health, community leaders and others to tackle violent crime and its underlying causes.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice.",

                    "details": "The European Commission recently introduced mandatory Ecodesign minimum energy performance standards and Energy Labels for refrigerating appliances which have a direct sales function. These new standards will lead to a significant reduction in the energy used in commercial refrigerating appliances, by encouraging manufacturers to innovate in the design of these appliances, without impeding shopping.\r\n\r\nMinimum energy performance standards are technology neutral, so do not prescribe that manufacturers should increase efficiency by putting doors on appliances. Rather, they set a minimum energy efficiency level that all manufacturers placing products on the market must meet.  The legislation therefore supports innovation by allowing the manufacturer to meet the requirements in the most effective way possible, which could include but is not restricted to putting doors on fridges. It also now sets requirements on material efficiency obligations on features such as repairability, dismantlability and recyclability to reduce their overall environmental impact.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, the ecodesign policy overall is estimated to save around 8 MtCO2 and \u00a3100 on bills for the average dual-fuel household whilst also yielding a Net Present Value (NPV) to the UK of \u00a316bn (2015-30). Net energy savings of implementing the commercial refrigeration requirements is estimated to be around 6 TWh between 2021 and 2040, equivalent to approximately 800 kt Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2e).\r\n\r\nThe Government is encouraging the uptake of highly energy-efficient refrigerated display cabinets by the retail sector through the Energy Technology List Scheme which is it\u2019s register of the best performing commercial products.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 update to the Energy Technology List has raised the performance requirements for refrigerated display cabinets to capture the top 25 percent of products available on the UK market across the range of cabinet types; horizontal and vertical chillers and freezers.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the Energy Technology List encourages high energy performance standards, leaving manufacturers to innovate and meet these requirements, be it through the use of doors and blinds or through the use of shelf edge technology to direct air inwards on open cabinets. This approach encourages the use of the most efficient products to suit specific retailer requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also taking action to improve energy efficiency across businesses by at least 20% by 2030, with the retail sector supported by the measures below: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme, which requires all large businesses to audit by 5 December 2019 their energy use in buildings, processes (including refrigeration) and transport and identify energy saving opportunities;\r\n\u2022\tA new Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting framework from April 2019. This legislation covers all UK quoted and large UK businesses (an estimated 11,900 organisations), requiring them to disclose energy and emissions information and details of the key energy efficiency actions taken in their annual reports;\r\n\u2022\tThe Climate Change Agreements Scheme encourages improvements in energy efficiency across 53 industrial sectors, including supermarkets, in return for significant discounts of over \u00a3200M p.a. from the Climate Change Levy, the key business energy tax.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

                    "details": "An identity check has been in our electoral system since the 19th century \u2013 we are updating it for this century. We merely need to walk up to the polling station and say our name, under current law. Voter ID is part of a body of work this Government is delivering to strengthen the integrity of our electoral system and give the public confidence that our elections are secure and fit for the 21st century. If people are confident about the electoral system, they are more likely to participate in it. In our current electoral system, there is undeniable potential for electoral fraud and the perception of this undermines public confidence in our democracy.\r\n\r\nThe Government has included a commitment to national roll out of voter ID requirements across Great Britain in their manifesto. In the Queen\u2019s Speech, the Government stated that we will bring forward measures that will improve the integrity and security of each elector\u2019s vote, whether they vote at a polling station or elsewhere. These measures are part of a wider initiative to improve trust in the integrity of the electoral process, maintain public confidence and support equality and inclusivity in our electoral system.\r\n\r\nElectors will be required to show an approved form of photographic ID before casting their vote in a polling station across Great Britain, at General Elections, and at local elections in England. The list of approved ID will not be limited to passports and driving licences - a range of documents will be accepted. Any voter who does not have an approved form of ID will be able to apply, free of charge, for a local electoral ID from their local authority to ensure that everyone eligible to vote has the opportunity to.\r\n \r\nVoter ID has applied to elections in Northern Ireland since 1985. Both the pilots and the Northern Irish experience demonstrate that the requirement to provide ID before voting does not have a negative effect on election turnout or participation.\r\n\r\nThe Government has worked with local authorities across England to pilot voter ID at local elections in 2018 and 2019. Both rounds of voter ID pilots were evaluated by both the independent Electoral Commission and the Cabinet Office, and those evaluations were published online. The evaluations of the voter ID pilots show that these pilots were a success as the overwhelming majority of electors who turned up to vote did so with the right documents and had confidence in knowing how to cast their vote. In Pendle and Woking, which piloted photographic ID in 2019, 99.6% of people who attended a polling station were able to show the right photo ID and were issued with a ballot paper.\r\n\r\nBased on the evaluations there is no indication that the ID requirement negatively affected the intention to vote for any consistent specific demographic group across the pilot authorities. Showing ID is something people of all backgrounds already do every day, for example to take out a library book, claim benefits or pick up a parcel from the post office. Proving who you are before you make a decision of huge importance at the ballot box should be no different.\r\n\r\nThe Government will continue to work closely with the Electoral Commission and other organisations who are experts in the delivery of elections, and continue to welcome the views of all stakeholders with an interest in voter ID as we take forward measures to improve the integrity and accessibility of elections.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office",

                    "details": "The UK is deeply concerned by Turkey\u2019s military operation in north-east Syria. \r\n\r\nPrior to the operation, we had repeatedly warned Turkey against conducting an intervention, noting that it risked undermining the stability and security of the region, harming the ongoing campaign against Daesh, and worsening the ongoing humanitarian crisis there. \r\n\r\nFollowing the start of the operation, on 10 October, the Foreign Secretary spoke to Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu and expressed the UK\u2019s grave concerns. The Prime Minister repeated this to President Erdogan on 12 October where he urged Turkey to end their operation and agree a ceasefire.  On the same day, the Foreign Secretary also addressed this issue at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.\r\n\r\nAt the Foreign Affairs Council held on 14 October, the UK joined our European Union partners in condemning the Turkish action. We also discussed arms exports to Turkey with our European partners. The Foreign Secretary subsequently informed the House of Commons on 15 October that UK exports of military arms to Turkey that might be used in this operation, had been suspended subject to the review that will take place. \r\n\r\nThe UK also joined with fellow European members of the UN Security Council to request a discussion of the situation in north east Syria in the Security Council on 10 and 16 October.\r\n \r\nWe have been closely monitoring reports of violations of international humanitarian law during the operation. We are deeply concerned by reports of summary executions by Turkish-supported Syrian armed groups, including of Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf on 12 October. We condemn these killings, and have made clear to Turkey the need for an investigation.\r\n\r\nWe have also been clear that any efforts at deliberate demographic change following the operation would be unacceptable. We underlined this in a joint statement with partners including the US, France and Germany on 26 September, and in an EU statement on 9 October.\r\n\r\nFollowing US Vice-President Pence, discussions with President Erdogan in Ankara on 17 October, a five-day Turkish \u2018ceasefire\u2019 in north east Syria was declared.  This would allow the US to facilitate an orderly withdrawal of Kurdish forces from the \u2018safe zone\u2019 along the Turkish-Syrian border.  If achieved, Turkey agreed to make the ceasefire permanent and the US would remove its sanctions against Turkey.  No new US sanctions would be proposed in the meantime.\r\n \r\nThe UK welcomes this temporary suspension in fighting and the steps taken to implement the agreement. We want to see this lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities. The Prime Minister conveyed this message to President Erdogan on 20 October.\r\n\r\nThe UK government will continue to urge Turkey to to bring an end to its unilateral military action.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely, maintaining regular contact with our international allies including the US, EU and NATO.\r\n\r\nWe remain committed to the Global Coalition Against Daesh and to the long-term security of the region. We pay tribute to the courage and sacrifices made by the Syrian Democratic Forces in their successful efforts against Daesh in Syria. We are in close contact with international partners on the impact of recent developments on the counter-Daesh campaign.\r\n\r\nWe are also concerned by the human cost of the Turkish intervention in a region of Syria where over 1.5 million people were already in need of humanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\nThe UK has already committed \u00a340 million to north east Syria this financial year, to help address some of the most acute needs, including shelter, water, food and healthcare.  We are hopeful that this money can be spent as planned. The Department for International Development is in daily contact with local partners and with the UN, both to ensure that people delivering assistance on the ground are safe, and to assess any impact on their ability to assist those in need. We have called on all parties to ensure that humanitarian agencies are able to operate safely on the ground.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office.\r\n",

                    "details": "Comparisons made in this petition between other countries and the National Minimum Wage do not take into account the full package of measures available to support people in retirement. We are committed to ensuring economic security for people at every stage of their life, including when they reach retirement.\r\n\r\nWe spend over \u00a3120 billion on benefits for pensioners, including the \u00a399 billion on the State Pension predicted for this year 2019/20. State pension spend is expected to increase from 5.0% of GDP in 2022-23 to 6.9% in 2067-68.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to make meaningful comparisons between pension schemes in different countries because there are so many fundamental differences in the way they are run. You have to look at the whole system, not just State Pension.\r\n\r\nThere are many other factors to take into account \u2013 different tax systems, different healthcare systems, different pension ages, cost of living, access to occupational pensions and the availability of other social security benefits, as well as the provision of services and goods free to pensioners or at concessionary rates.\r\n\r\nThis petition suggests linking the State Pension and the National Minimum Wage. The two have different purposes, and a direct comparison cannot be drawn.  The National Minimum Wage is designed to protect low income workers and provide an incentive to work by ensuring that all workers benefit from as generous a wage as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Government introduced the Triple Lock and recommitted itself to it for the duration of this Parliament, guaranteeing that up to the full amounts of the basic and new State Pensions will rise by the highest of average earnings growth, price inflation, or 2.5%. As a result, the full yearly amount of the basic State Pension in 2019/20 is around \u00a3675 higher than if it had just been up-rated by earnings since April 2010. That\u2019s a rise of over \u00a31,600 in cash terms.\r\n\r\nThis Government has always acknowledged that it is important that a safety net exists for those pensioners who find themselves without an adequate income in retirement.  Pension Credit is a means-tested benefit, paid for out of general taxation.  It is made up of 2 parts: the Guarantee Credit, which tops up other income to a standard minimum level (for a single person this is currently \u00a3167.25 a week and for a couple \u00a3255.25) and, for those who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016, the Savings Credit, which is an extra amount for those who have made some additional provision for their retirement. The Government also continues to provide some non-means tested benefits for people in retirement.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, the Government introduced the new State Pension to provide a simpler, clearer and a sustainable foundation for private saving. With the new State Pension, people will know from a much younger age how much they\u2019re likely to get, providing a solid base for their saving and retirement planning.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions.\r\n",

                    "details": "Research is a crucial part of the fight against cancer. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) funds health research through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to improve the health and wealth of the nation. Cancer research expenditure has risen from \u00a3101 million in 2010/11 to \u00a3136 million in 2017/18. This constitutes the largest investment in a disease area.\r\n\r\nIn May 2018 the Government announced \u00a340 million over five years for brain tumour research as part of the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission. This includes funding for childhood brain tumour research. This announcement will remain a priority within any Spending Review.\r\n\r\nFunding will be invested through the NIHR, to support a wide range of research from early translation (experimental medicine), through clinical, and on to applied health and care research. In essence, this will support the translation of laboratory discoveries into treatments and better care for patients, including childhood cancers. \r\n\r\nAs with other Government funders of health research, the NIHR does not generally allocate funding for specific disease areas. The level of research spend in a particular area, such as DIPG or neuroblastoma, is driven by factors including scientific potential and the number and scale of successful funding applications. \r\n\r\nWe are relying on researchers to submit high-quality research proposals in this very difficult area. To encourage such applications, we have released a NIHR Highlight Notice on brain tumour research asking research teams to submit collaborative applications building on recent initiatives and investments. The highlight notice appears to have led to an increase in applications and these are now being considered.\r\n\r\nWe are working closely with research funding partners such as Cancer Research UK, the Medical Research Council, and brain tumour charities, who fund research into new scientific discoveries. We stand ready to translate these new discoveries as quickly as possible into new treatments and diagnostics for patients via the NIHR.\r\n\r\nWe are also working closely with our research funding partners, and other stakeholders, via the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission, which will meet several of Dame Tessa\u2019s campaign requests to improve research and care for adults and children with brain cancer.\r\n\r\nThe NIHR is funding and supporting a range of research for children with neuroblastoma. For example: the NIHR Great Ormond Street Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) is researching the use of imaging to assess the efficacy of induction chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma; the NIHR Newcastle Biomedical Research Centre is  studying the genetic profiles of high risk neuroblastomas to provide predictive and prognostic biomarkers for current and future targeted therapies; and the NIHR Royal Marsden Biomedical Research Centre is developing preclinical models of neuroblastoma and childhood soft tissue sarcoma cells for the development of target-driven drug treatment.\r\n\r\nThe NIHR Clinical Research Network has over 800 cancer trials and studies recruiting or in set-up. Through the Network, the proportion of patients entering cancer clinical trials and studies is more than double that in any other country for which data exists, including the United States.\r\n\r\nIn September 2016 the Secretary of State for Health announced an \u00a3816 million investment in 20 NIHR Biomedical Research Centres for 5 years from April 2017. This funding includes the NIHR Royal Marsden/Institute of Cancer Research BRC which will focus exclusively on cancer research and will receive \u00a343 million over five years from April 2017. Five other BRCs will have dedicated cancer research themes. The funding amount for cancer research over 5 years across all BRCs is an estimated \u00a3131 million.\r\n\r\nThe NIHR is committed to the involvement, engagement and participation of children and young people in research, supporting researchers and funders, as well as empowering children and young people to lead their own journey with research.\r\n\r\nThe NIHR have many children and young people (CYP) initiatives ongoing, such as:\r\nRaising awareness e.g. some Local Clinical Research Networks have set up Children and Young People's Forums to engage them in raising awareness of health research among their peers;\r\nContributing to feedback. In 2018/19 over 900 children and young people (11% of respondents) gave feedback about their experience of participating in clinical research through the NIHR Research Participant Experience Survey.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

There is also provision for those who do not meet requirements in exceptional circumstances.  Alternatively, the family life rules enable families to regularise their status where there is a qualifying partner or child (British or lived continuously in the UK for at least seven years) and it is unreasonable to expect family life to continue outside the UK or for the child to leave.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to know the exact number of the illegal population in the UK and so we do not seek to make any official estimates on this.  Exit checks introduced in April 2015 will, over time, provide more detailed insights into the behaviour of migrants and how they comply with immigration rules.  However, the data obtained do not provide the total number of illegal migrants currently in the UK and as such information on how many individuals have entered the UK illegally is not available.\r\n\r\nThe Government remains committed to an immigration policy which welcomes and celebrates people here legally, but which deters illegal immigration, prevents the abuse of benefits and services, removes immigration offenders and foreign national offenders from the UK and disrupts the organised crime groups that prey on the vulnerable.\r\n\r\nHome Office.\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

                    "details": "The Government recognises the distress and disruption that acquisitive crime can cause and the effect it can have on victims, including the impact on people who rely on the tools of their trade to earn a living.\r\n\r\nThe Theft Act 1968 includes robust measures for dealing with crimes of theft and handling stolen goods, including tool theft. The Act provides a maximum penalty of seven years\u2019 imprisonment for theft and a maximum penalty of fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment for handling stolen goods. In addition, the Act provides powers to tackle the threat of people going equipped to steal, with a maximum penalty of three years\u2019 imprisonment. Therefore, the Government has no plans to amend existing legislation, including introducing minimum fines for theft offences, at this time.\r\n\r\nMaking stolen goods harder to sell on is a key part of making all forms of acquisitive crime less attractive to thieves. That is why we continue to work with the police to understand better the buying and selling \u2018journey\u2019 for a range of goods to inform what more can be done to tackle the stolen goods market.\r\n\r\nThis work will build on current police activity, which includes working with key partners such as product manufacturers, security companies and representatives from the insurance industry to make goods \u2018harder to steal, harder to sell\u2019; and encouraging the public to mark and register their property. Indeed, police forces have funded the provision of over half a million property marking kits to households across England and Wales, which has helped enable those who steal or handle stolen property to be brought to justice.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we are aware of the availability of devices that can be used to bypass vehicle security to gain entry. There are legitimate reasons for people owning such devices or other tools to help themselves or others get back into their vehicles when they have locked themselves out. While there may be a risk that criminals will use such equipment, the evidence pointing to the use of such devices in vehicle-related theft is limited and anecdotal, typically identified during the arrest or subsequent searches of a suspected offender.\r\n\r\nHowever, we understand that the use of such devices is a concern. That is why we are working with partners to review whether further measures are required to stop devices that may be used to compromise vehicle security falling into criminals\u2019 hands, and on 21 March we welcomed the launch of security ratings by Thatcham Research to help consumers better understand how vulnerable new cars are to theft.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, consequential financial harm and the impact of theft on a business are factors which will be taken into consideration by the courts when assessing the harm suffered by the victim or others. Victims of crime have the right to make a Victim Personal Statement (VPS) to explain in their own words how a crime has affected them, whether physically, emotionally, financially or in any other way. This is always passed to the court. Similarly, businesses can provide an Impact Statement for Business (ISB) to set out impact of the crime. It does not have to be limited to the direct cost of the crime and can include wider impacts such as staff morale and reputational damage.\r\n\r\nThe court will pass what it judges to be the appropriate sentence, having regard to all the circumstances of the offence and of the offender. This will include taking into account, so far as the court considers it appropriate, the impact of the offence on the victim as set out in a VPS or ISB.\r\n\r\nFurther information about these impact statements can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/victim-personal-statement and https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/impact-statements-for-business.\r\n\r\nHome Office",

Hundreds of thousands of international students will be able to benefit from this route. It will also assist the UK\u2019s higher education sector as they compete in a global market for international students.\r\n\r\nThe new route will be launched in the summer of 2021. Any student who successfully completes their degree-level course at a qualifying institution in the summer of 2021 or thereafter will be eligible to apply. This includes students who are already studying. Announcing the route now enables prospective students to decide where to study, knowing they have the option of staying in the UK to work after completing their studies.\r\n\r\nAll students accepted for the Graduate route will receive two years non-extendable leave. During that time, they will be able to work, or look for work, at any skill level. Graduates will also be able to switch into skilled work once they have found a suitable job.\r\n\r\nThose who graduate and whose leave expires before the route is introduced will not be eligible for the Graduate route. The vast majority of these students will have commenced their course prior to the announcement of the new route, and therefore had no expectation of benefiting from such a route when they applied to study in the UK. However, these students can still work in the UK post-study if they secure a graduate level job which meets the requirements of the Tier 2 skilled work route. They will also continue to benefit from the generous provisions which allow them to switch into skilled work on favourable terms. They are exempt from the Resident Labour Market Test, have a reduced salary threshold and are not subject to the annual cap on numbers under this route.\r\n\r\nThis route is being introduced to help new graduates who complete their education in the UK to get a head-start on their career and allow them to look for work as soon as they have successfully graduated. It is entirely appropriate that they should benefit from this route, rather than those with degrees previously gained in the UK who have already progressed in their career, whether in the UK or overseas.\r\n\r\nThe earlier Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) route was closed in 2012 because evidence suggested that the route was open to abuse, and many on the route were unemployed or in low-skilled work. The Graduate route will have safeguards to ensure that we have control over who can access it, in order to prevent such abuse in the future. Students will only be eligible for the route if they can demonstrate that they have successfully passed their course at degree level or above, studied at a trusted institution, and complied with the terms of their student visa.\r\n\r\nHome Office.",

                    "summary": "The off-payroll working rules do not apply to the self-employed. They ensure that individuals who work like employees but through their own company pay broadly the same taxes as the directly employed.",
                    "details": "The off-payroll working rules have been in place for nearly 20 years. They are designed to ensure that individuals working like employees, but through their own limited company, pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs) as those who are employed directly. The rules support a fair tax system by ensuring that two individuals working in a similar way for the same employer pay broadly the same tax and NICs, even if one of them structures their work through a company. \r\n\r\nThe rules apply only to individuals who are working like employees through their own company and do not apply to the self-employed.\r\n\r\nNon-compliance with these rules is widespread. HMRC estimate that only 10% of those who should be applying the rules do so. People who are not complying with these rules are not paying their fair share of employment taxes resulting in projected costs to the Exchequer of \u00a31.3 billion a year by 2023/24. This money would otherwise go into funding hospitals, schools and other public services.\r\n\r\nTo address this, in April 2017 the Government reformed the way in which the rules operate in the public sector. Public sector bodies are now responsible for determining whether the rules apply to individuals they contract with through limited companies, and for ensuring that they and the individuals who work for them pay the right tax. HMRC analysis of income tax and NICs receipts shows this has been successful in improving compliance, with an estimated additional \u00a3550 million being raised over the first 12 months. Independent research has also shown that this change has so far been achieved without disrupting public services or reducing market flexibility. \r\n\r\nThough the rules are now operating effectively in the public sector, non-compliance is growing elsewhere. That is why at Autumn Budget 2018 the Government announced that it would extend the reform to all medium and large organisations from April 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Government has consulted extensively on the proposed extension of the reform to other sectors, and on 11 July published its response to the most recent consultation: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/816059/Off-payroll_working_rules_from_Apri__2020_-_summary_of_responses.pdf.\r\n\r\nHaving listened to stakeholders, the Government decided not to apply the reform to the smallest 1.5 million organisations. It will take effect from April 2020 to give organisations time to prepare. The Government has also decided to bring forward legislation requiring organisations to maintain a client-led status disagreement process to allow individuals and fee-payers to challenge the client\u2019s status determinations directly and in real time. \r\n\r\nThe Government is currently seeking feedback from experts and stakeholders on the draft legislation for inclusion in Finance Bill 2019. \r\n\r\nFalling within the off-payroll working tax rules does not change an individual\u2019s status for employment rights as there are currently separate frameworks for tax and for employment rights, with no direct link between them. However, as set out in the Good Work Plan published in December 2018, the Government agrees that reducing the differences between the tax and rights frameworks for employment status to a minimum is important. In the meantime, it is right that the Government takes action to improve compliance with existing tax rules. Those who wish to challenge their employment status for rights can take their case to an employment tribunal, regardless of their tax status.\r\n\r\nThe Government values the contribution of flexible workers to the UK economy. However, it is also under an obligation to ensure fairness between individuals who work in a similar way.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury.",

                    "details": "Analysis of maternal deaths, stillbirths and neonatal deaths, undertaken by MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK) at the University of Oxford, shows that poor outcomes are much higher for mothers and babies from Black/Black British and Asian/Asian British ethnic groups and women living in the most deprived areas of the country.\r\n \r\nBlack women are five times more likely to die from causes related to pregnancy than white women. Black babies have a 121% increased risk for stillbirth and a 50% increased risk for neonatal death (i.e. dying within 28 days after birth) compared to white babies. Asian women are twice as likely to die from causes related to pregnancy than white women. Asian babies have a 55% increased risk for stillbirth and a 66% increased risk for neonatal mortality compared to white babies. Babies born to mothers in the most deprived areas of the country have a 30% increased risk neonatal mortality. For all of these groups the risk of a poor pregnancy outcome compared to white women or women in less deprived areas is increasing.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Long-Term Plan takes a concerted and systematic approach to reducing health inequalities and addressing unwarranted variation in care. The Chief Midwifery Officer, Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent OBE, is leading work to support maternity services to provide high-quality maternity care for all women with a scale and intensity that is proportionate to the level of disadvantage (known as \u2018proportionate universalism\u2019). Initiatives recently introduced to reduce and eliminate health inequalities in maternity include:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTargeted and enhanced continuity of carer \u2013 Evidence suggests that continuity of carer can significantly improve outcomes for women from ethnic minorities and those living in deprived areas. The NHS Long-Term Plan describes how an enhanced and targeted continuity of carer model is being implemented to help improve outcomes for the most vulnerable mothers and babies. Continuity of carer teams are being developed and launched across the country with the aim that in 2019, 20% of pregnant women will be offered the opportunity to have the same midwife caring for them throughout their pregnancy, during birth and postnatally. We will continue to work with midwives, mothers and their families to implement continuity of carer so that, by March 2021, most women receive continuity of the person caring for them during pregnancy, during birth and postnatally. This will be targeted towards women from Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups and those living in deprived areas, so that by 2024, 75% of women from BAME groups and a similar percentage of women from the most deprived communities will receive continuity of carer from their midwife throughout pregnancy, labour and the postnatal period. This will help reduce pre-term births, hospital admissions, the need for intervention during labour, and women\u2019s experience of care.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe NHS Planning Guidance 2019/20 sets an expectation that local systems will to start to implement continuity of carer models for Black and Asian women and those in the most deprived areas. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe Department of Health and Social Care is funding research through the National Institute of Health Research\u2019s Policy Research Unit (PRU) in Maternal and Neonatal Health and Care at the University of Oxford to investigate the factors associated with the excess perinatal mortality experienced by BAME babies; and identify the factors associated with the excess risk of maternal death for Black and South Asian women.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tImproving ethnic coding in maternity data systems - Ethnic coding data is not present for 16% of Maternity Services Dataset records. We will work with NHS Resolution to include an effective incentive to improve coding completeness in the Maternity Safety Incentive Scheme in future years.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHealth Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB): learning from parents - Work is underway with HSIB to learn from their interviews with parents, including an analysis by ethnicity and deprivation index.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGap analysis for each workstream of the Maternity Transformation Programme - We are working with NHS England / NHS Improvement and other system partners to map current work and additional actions and support that may be needed to reduce and eliminate inequalities.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMeasurement - Health inequality measures covering a range of clinical quality indicators have been developed as part of the NHS Long-Term Plan work.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care.\r\nThis is a revised response.

This Guidance was revised in 2017 following public consultation and the sections on identification of those under investigation were reinforced.\r\n\r\nThe Guidance highlights the importance of respecting suspects\u2019 rights to privacy.  It states that the police will not name those arrested, or suspected, of a crime, save in exceptional circumstances where there is a legitimate policing purpose to do so.  A legitimate policing purpose may include circumstances such as a threat to life, the prevention or detection of crime, or where police have made a public warning about a wanted individual.  The naming of an arrested person before they are charged must be authorised by a chief officer who must also ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service is consulted.\r\n\r\nThis approach recognises that there is a risk of unfair damage to the reputation of those persons, particularly if they are never charged.  It strikes a balance between the rights of suspects to privacy and the need to prevent and investigate crime.  \r\n\r\nThe College Guidance cannot and does not seek to prevent the media from relying on information from sources outside the police in order to confirm identities.  Publishing names of suspects may be unlawful if it is found to be in contempt of court, in breach of a reporting restriction, defamatory or in breach of any right to privacy.  Individuals who feel that they have been wrongly named can either make a complaint to the publishers\u2019 self-regulator or take action through the courts.\r\n\r\nOnce it has been decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect with an offence, the principle of open justice requires that the defendant should be identified in the usual way, unless there is an exceptional and legitimate policing purpose for not doing so or reporting restrictions apply. A decision not to name an individual who has been charged should be taken in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service.\r\n\r\nEvidence does not suggest that false allegations are widespread.  On the contrary, it is the under-reporting of crime to the police that is known to be particularly acute for sexual offences.  However, when false allegations of sexual offences are made, they can have a serious adverse impact on the person accused.  Wrongly and deliberately accusing someone of a sexual offence is a very serious matter.  If there is evidence of this, the accuser could be prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.\r\n\r\nHome Office.",

Following a consultation, the documents did not suggest there will be major changes in the rationale and restrictions from their current guidelines which were last reviewed in 2009.\r\n\r\nThe main conclusion from the WHO reviews is that EMF exposures below the limits recommended in the ICNIRP guidelines do not appear to have any known consequence on health. There may be a small increase in overall exposure to radio waves when 5G is added to an existing network or in a new area; but, this is expected to remain low relative to guidelines.\r\n\r\nInternational product standards applying to mobile phones and other transmitting devices, health and safety legislation, and planning policy for telecommunications developments all look towards compliance with exposure restrictions from the ICNIRP guidelines. The UK network operators are already committed to complying with the guidelines.\r\n\r\nA small number of countries have adopted lower restriction values than the ICNIRP guidelines, and it reflects the different ways they have approached concerns about this topic.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom follows the ICNIRP guidelines, along with many other countries and there is no convincing evidence that adverse health effects can occur if these guidelines are complied with.\r\n\r\nPHE is committed to keeping its advice under review and will update its advice should new evidence dictate it necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) lead on environmental issues for Government.\r\n\r\nElectromagnetic radiation (EMR) has the potential to impact the movement of insects and some species of animals, but there is currently no evidence that human-made EMR, at realistic field levels, has population level impacts on (a) plants, (b) animals or (c) insects.\r\n\r\nThe latest overview of evidence of current knowledge on the impacts of artificial electromagnetic radiation (EMR) on wildlife, was written in 2018, funded by the EU EKLIPSE project (Knowledge & Learning Mechanism on Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services). \r\n\r\nThe following comprehensive scientific review reports and statements have informed this advice.

The Government is committed to further reforming the postal vote system to prevent fraud and ensure our elections are secure. \r\n\r\nThe Government has no plans to restrict postal voting to elderly and disabled voters. Postal voting has proved popular with many voters who find it a convenient way to cast their vote, including those whose work regularly takes them away from home. Many people work at times which clash with polling station opening times and others work away from home on a regular basis or are at risk of being called away so opt to use a postal vote. Unforeseen circumstances such as temporarily having to relocate for a period of time to provide care for a relative or friend could also impact someone\u2019s ability to vote in person. Postal votes are also widely used by military service personnel, Crown servants and their families based abroad. UK citizens living abroad also rely on postal votes, especially where it is not possible for them to appoint a proxy.  \r\n\r\nRestricting postal voting to elderly or disabled voters would prevent other groups such as these from availing themselves of the same benefits that postal voting can provide. \r\n\r\nThere are already measures in place designed to enhance the security of postal voting, but the Government made a manifesto commitment to reform postal voting and is working to make the process more robust. \r\n\r\nIn 2016 (the then) Sir Eric Pickles conducted a review of electoral fraud which considered postal voting and identified a number of areas in which the existing rules around postal voting at elections could be tightened. The Government responded by outlining a series of measures to further secure the postal voting process. \r\n\r\nThe Government will be seeking to extend the provisions on ballot secrecy already in place for voting in person, to postal voting. The Government will look for opportunities to introduce measures that will prohibit party campaigners from handling postal votes, and apply a limit to the number of postal ballots any one individual can hand in at a \r\n\r\npolling station. Our intention would be for this measure to be backed up by a new offence; this will make a significant contribution to enhancing the security of postal voting. \r\n\r\nThese and other measures represent a comprehensive approach to addressing the risks of postal voting fraud secure. \r\n\r\nCabinet Office.\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

                    "details": "Electoral fraud is an unacceptable crime that strikes at a core principle of our democracy - that everyone\u2019s vote matters.\r\n\r\nIn our current system, there is undeniable potential for electoral fraud and the perception of this undermines public confidence in our democracy. Voter ID is part of a body of work this Government is delivering to strengthen the integrity of our electoral system and give the public confidence that our elections are secure and fit for the 21st century. If people are confident about the electoral system, they are more likely to participate in it.\r\n\r\nThe impact of electoral fraud on voters can be significant and takes away their right to vote as they want, whether through intimidation, bribery or by impersonating someone and casting their vote. There is undeniable potential for people to cast other people\u2019s votes unless their identity is checked at the polling station. Voter ID is a reasonable and proportionate measure to prevent this and ensure your vote is yours, and yours alone.\r\n\r\nBuilding on Sir Eric Pickles\u2019 comprehensive review of electoral fraud published in 2016, pilots were run to give us a deeper understanding of how voter ID will work on a wider scale - and what works best for voters - before national roll-out. Voter ID pilots were conducted on a voluntary basis in five local authorities in May 2018 (Watford, Woking, Swindon, Bromley and Gosport) and ten diverse local authorities in 2019 (Mid Sussex, North West Leicestershire, Watford, Braintree, Broxtowe, Craven, Derby, North Kesteven, Pendle and Woking).\r\n \r\nTo evolve the existing, but outdated, verbal identification test that happens in a polling station, each local authority tested one of four models of voter ID in their pilot. This included checks of either photo ID, photo and non-photo ID, traditional poll cards or poll cards with scannable barcodes. Local authorities provided alternative methods of ID, free of charge, whenever an elector was unsure they were able to produce the required ID, to ensure everyone who was registered had the opportunity to vote.\r\n\r\nThis Government takes its Public Sector Equality Duty extremely seriously. In addition to the pilots, we consulted with a broad range of charities and civil society organisations, to make sure that voter ID will work for everybody and have recently published our pre-pilot findings.\r\n\r\nThe Government has included a commitment to national roll out of voter ID requirements across Great Britain in their manifesto. Both last year\u2019s pilots and the decades of experience of Northern Ireland - including at the most recent local elections - show that voter ID does not have an adverse effect on election turnout or participation. This Government is committed to rolling out this effective anti-fraud measure and bringing the whole of the United Kingdom into line with Northern Ireland, which has had ID to vote in elections since 1985.\r\n\r\nIn line with the 2018 pilot evaluation, the 2019 pilots have been evaluated by both the independent Electoral Commission and the Cabinet Office. These evaluations were published on Monday 22 July 2019.\r\n\r\nWe will be looking carefully at the evaluations from both the 2018 and 2019 pilots to help inform our next steps and shape how voter ID will work when it is introduced nationwide.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office.\r\n",

This replaces the 50:50 proposal put forward for consultation in July. DHSC will work to expedite this process and introduce these changes as soon as possible \u2013 we expect this to be in time for the next tax year, subject to the consultation responses.\r\n\r\nFollowing consultation and regulation changes, the new rules would allow senior clinicians in England and Wales to set the exact level of pension accrual at the start of each year, potentially choosing a lower accrual rate and paying lower contributions depending on their financial situation. For example, a 30% accrual rate, or any other percentage in 10% increments subject to views in the consultation. This would give them room to take on additional work without breaching their annual allowance and facing tax charges.\r\n\r\nThe proposals follow the commitment made in the NHS People Plan to deliver a fairer and more flexible approach to the NHS Pension Scheme for senior clinicians. Guidance will also be given to employers setting out how they can provide flexibility at a local level this financial year for clinicians to do extra work without breaching limits for pensions tax relief.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Pension Scheme is a devolved matter in Scotland and Northern Ireland, so it would be a decision for the Scottish Government or Northern Ireland Administration to propose pension flexibilities for senior clinicians in those nations.\r\n \r\nAlongside the proposals for full NHS pension flexibility, HM Treasury will review how the tapered annual allowance operates in order to support the delivery of public services such as the NHS.

                    "details": "State Pension age (SPa) reform has focused on maintaining the right balance between sustainability of State Pension and fairness between generations. People are living longer, for example, a girl born in 1951 was expected to live to 81.6 years and a boy to 77.0 years. By 2019, these figures had increased by over 10 years to 92.4 years for newly born girls and by over 12 years for boys to 89.7 years. Women retiring today can still expect to receive the State Pension for over 2 years longer than men. If SPa had not been equalised, women would spend on average over 40% of their adult life in receipt of State Pension.\r\n\r\nThe SPa review can be found here:\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/630065/state-pension-age-review-final-report.pdf\r\n\r\nAny amendments that reverse the changes to SPa already established would result in significant public spending. Doing so would mean that people of working age, especially younger people, would bear a greater financial burden to support the rising costs of the pensions system, and would create inequality between men and women. The Government estimates that over the period 2010/11 to 2025/26, the total additional costs for reversing women\u2019s SPa back to 60 and men\u2019s SPa back to 65 would be around \u00a3206 billion, in 2018/19 prices. These costs would increase to around \u00a3215 billion when taking into account the costs of other pensioner benefits and savings made on working age benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Government has done a lot to improve pensions for everyone, particularly for women. Future female pensioners will benefit on average from a higher new State Pension payment, and from the expansion of Automatic Enrolment. Women who reached SPa in 2016 are estimated to receive more State Pension on average over their lifetime than women ever have before.\r\n\r\nIt has always been our view that the changes made to women\u2019s SPa are lawful. The High Court has recently looked at SPa changes affecting 1950\u2019s born women and concluded that there was no legal duty on the government to notify affected individuals when altering SPa.\r\n\r\nThe court recognised that successive governments consulted with a wide range of interested parties before the changes to SPa were introduced. The High Court also concluded that there was no discrimination on the grounds of gender or age and that the SPa rules that equalise men and women\u2019s SPa correct historic discrimination against men.\r\n\r\nThe full judgment can be found here: https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/r-on-the-application-of-julie-delve-and-karen-glynn-v-the-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions/\r\n\r\nDepartment of Work and Pensions",

                    "details": "There is no Government proposal to increase SPa to 70. The recommendation was made in a recent report published by the Centre for Social Justice. This is not a Government report. \r\n\r\nChanges to State Pension age were made by successive governments from 1995 onwards, following public consultation and extensive debates in both Houses of Parliament. The law to increase SPa to 66, 67 and 68 was originally made in 2007 by the Labour government, with broad Parliamentary agreement. Under the current law men and womens\u2019 SPa will reach 66 by October 2020, with further rises to 67 by 2028 and to 68 by 2046. \r\n\r\nPeople are living for longer. For example, a girl born in 1951 was expected to live to 81.6 years and a boy to 77.0 years. By 2019 this had increased to 92.4 and 89.7 for newly born girls and boys. The Government reviews SPa every 6 years, to take into account changes in life expectancy and other relevant factors. The first review was completed in 2017 and proposed bringing forward the rise in SPa to 68 by 7 years, to take place by 2039. The SPa review can be found here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/630065/state-pension-age-review-final-report.pdf\r\n\r\nIt followed an independent review which was led by the former Chair of the Confederation of British Industry John Cridland, and the proposal to bring forward the increase in SPa to 68 was in line with his recommendation on when the next increase should take place. These changes will not be made law until the Government has reviewed future life expectancy projections. The independent review can be found here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/611460/independent-review-of-the-state-pension-age-smoothing-the-transition.pdf \r\n\r\nThe Government has done lots to improve pensions for everyone, particularly women. Future women pensioners will benefit on average from a higher new State Pension payment, and from the expansion of Automatic Enrolment. A woman retiring today can still expect to receive the State Pension for over 2 years longer than men. If SPa had not been equalised, women would spend on average over 40% of their adult life in retirement. The SPa reviews are based around the principle that people should spend a similar proportion of their adult life receiving the State Pension as the generation before them. This ensures fairness between different age groups and means that people retiring in future should not have a better or worse deal than people retiring today. \r\n\r\nAny amendments that reverse the changes to SPa already established would result in significant costs to the public purse. The Government estimates that over the period 2010/11 to 2025/26 the total additional costs for the State Pension would be around \u00a3206 billion, in 2018/19 prices. These costs would increase to around \u00a3215 billion when taking into account the costs of other pensioner benefits and savings made on in-work benefits (Pension Credit, Winter Fuel Payment, Employment Support Allowance, Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support and Universal Credit). Reversing the changes could also create a new inequality between men and women. The costings can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/analysis-relating-to-state-pension-age-changes-from-the-1995-and-2011-pensions-acts/analysis-relating-to-state-pension-age-changes-from-the-1995-and-2011-pensions-acts \r\n\r\nThe Government is helping older people remain in and return to work. There are more people aged 50-64 in employment than ever before; employment levels for older workers (aged 50+) are currently over 10 million. The \u2018Fuller Working Lives Strategy: A Partnership Approach\u2019, published in February 2017, aims to help older workers remain in or return to employment, and to change employer\u2019s attitudes. Government changed the law to create the right working environment to support older workers as part of the Fuller Working Lives strategy. For example, removing the Default Retirement Age, extending the right to request flexible working and supporting employers to recruit, re-train and retain older workers. A link to the document can be found here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/587654/fuller-working-lives-a-partnership-approach.pdf  \r\n\r\nThis Government believes that everyone deserves dignity and security in retirement. As a result of the introduction of the triple lock, the full yearly amount of the basic State Pension is now over \u00a3675 higher than if it had just been up-rated by earnings since April 2010. That\u2019s a rise of over \u00a31,600 in cash terms. The new State Pension, the State Pension age review framework, workplace pensions through automatic enrolment, and the development of policies and action in support of fuller working lives, will provide for a coherent strategy that will strengthen and sustain the UK\u2019s pensions system for many decades to come. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions.\r\n",

This is why we have established the EU Settlement Scheme, which is a free service that makes it easy for EU citizens and their family members to obtain the UK immigration status they need in order to remain here permanently. \r\n\r\nRegardless of whether the scheme was registration or application based, we would have to ask for much of the same information but what is important is that we have made the process as simple and straightforward as possible. In practice, the person only needs to complete three key steps \u2013 prove their identity, show that they live in the UK, and declare any criminal convictions. \r\n\r\nSince opening, over 750,000 applications have been received and hundreds of thousands of people have already been granted status under the scheme. \r\n\r\nProtecting the rights of all those who have made the UK their home has been our priority right from the start. The EU Settlement Scheme gives EU citizens and their family members evidence that they can use to demonstrate their rights in the UK. Throughout the process, the Home Office will be looking for reasons to grant status, not to refuse, and we will work with applicants to try to ensure they receive the status under the scheme for which they qualify.\r\n\r\nWe are determined that, through the EU Settlement Scheme, EU citizens who have made the UK their home will be able to continue with their lives here much as before. \r\n\r\nThe scheme protects the rights of EU citizens in UK law and gives them a secure digital status which, unlike a physical document, cannot be lost, stolen or tampered with. \r\n\r\nIn practice, the information required for a registration system would differ very little from the streamlined approach of the EU Settlement Scheme. However, a declaratory system \u2013 under which EU citizens were not required to obtain status and evidence of this \u2013 would risk causing confusion especially for the most vulnerable, and could in years to come find people struggling to prove their status. \r\n\r\nWe have taken great care to learn from the experience of the Windrush generation, and applying to the scheme will give EU citizens certainty that they will be able to evidence their rights in future. \r\n\r\nThe Government is also putting in place a series of measures to support applicants, which is why there are over 200 assisted digital locations across the UK, dedicated staff in our Settlement Resolution Centre and \u00a39 million available for 57 organisations across the UK to support an estimated 200,000 vulnerable people to apply.\r\n\r\nHome Office.",

                    "details": "There is no statutory framework in Northern Ireland allowing for lawful abortion.  Following previous court judgments, there is a limited exemption for an intervention to a pregnant woman that has the intent to cause a miscarriage, where this is carried out with the intention of protecting the woman against physical or mental health issues that are \u2018real and serious\u2019 and \u2018permanent or long term\u2019.\r\n\r\nUnder sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (which also applies in England and Wales) it is a criminal offence for any woman, being with child, unlawfully to do any act with intent to procure a miscarriage; and for any person unlawfully with intention to do an act to procure a miscarriage of any woman; or to unlawfully supply or procure drugs or instruments to cause an abortion.\r\n \r\nUnder the Northern Ireland devolution settlement, the following areas, relevant to the provision of abortion services, are \u201ctransferred matters\u201d and therefore devolved in Northern Ireland: health and social services; equal opportunities (including as provided for in equality law); and justice and policing.  As a result, any questions of reform or legislative changes to the law or policy in these areas are matters that are within the competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.\r\n \r\nThe UK Government operates in accordance with the convention that the UK Parliament will not normally legislate on devolved matters except with the agreement of the devolved legislature.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s preference therefore remains that any change to law on abortion, which we recognise is a highly sensitive devolved issue, on which there are a wide range of differing views, is taken forward by a restored Executive and functioning Assembly.\r\n \r\nIt remains the hope that devolved government can be restored at the earliest opportunity through the current talks process, so that it is the politicians of Northern Ireland that carefully consider, debate and take decisions on sensitive devolved issues in the interests of all the citizens of Northern Ireland. \r\n \r\nHowever, the Government also recognises the strength of feeling on the issue of abortion law reform, demonstrated by Parliament voting through the addition of section 9 to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019. \r\n \r\nThis section places a legal duty on the Government to regulate to provide access to abortion in Northern Ireland, in line with recommendations made by the UN Committee for Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).  This duty will come into effect if the Executive is not restored by 21 October 2019, with the regulations required to be in place by 31 March 2020.\r\n \r\nThis creates an interim period - from 21 October 2019 to 31 March 2020 - during which time the Government will work to ensure regulations are ready to be in place by 31 March 2020.  In terms of this interim period, if the duty to regulate to implement the CEDAW recommendations comes into effect, as section 9(2) of the Act provides, sections 58 and 59 of the OAPA will be repealed from 22 October 2019.  Further, a criminal moratorium will also come into effect on that date, meaning that no investigation may be carried out, and no criminal proceedings may be brought or continued, in respect of an offence under those sections under the law of Northern Ireland (whenever committed).\r\n \r\nCareful consideration is being given now to how we manage this interim period where the criminal law in Northern Ireland falls away, but services are unlikely to be widely available given the policy and delivery considerations required in the following months to implement the new framework by 31 March 2020.\r\n \r\nThis includes considering what guidance can be put in place in Northern Ireland to clarify the new state of the law, and ensuring the Government scheme that currently operates in England continues to be as accessible as possible for those women and girls from Northern Ireland seeking to access it in the interim period.  \r\n \r\nEnsuring the health and safety of women, and clarity for medical professionals, will be at the forefront of our approach at each stage of the process.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland Office.

                    "details": "Background\r\nThe off-payroll working rules were introduced in Finance Act 2000 and have been in place for nearly 20 years. They are designed to ensure that individuals working like employees but through their own company pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs) as those who are directly employed.\r\n\r\nIssue\r\nUnfortunately, non-compliance with these rules is widespread, and costs the Exchequer a great deal of money each year, at the cost of our vital public services, placing unfair pressure on taxpayers as a whole. To address this, in April 2017 the Government reformed the way in which the rules operate in the public sector. The reform moved responsibility for determining whether the off-payroll rules apply from individual contractors to the public bodies engaging them. The reform did not introduce a new tax.\r\n\r\nThe reform\r\nEvidence, including independent research conducted by IFF Research and Frontier Economics, suggests the public sector reform has been successful in improving compliance without creating disruption to the sector, or to its use of contingent labour. Revenue collected shows that since 2017, compliance with the existing off-payroll working rules has improved.\r\n\r\nThis approach is now being extended to large and medium organisations across all sectors. The Government has consulted extensively on the reform to the off-payroll working rules and its extension to all sectors, including by drawing on the public sector experience. We have also listened carefully to affected individuals and stakeholders. In response to feedback, the Government announced at Budget 2018 that the reform would not apply to engagements with the 1.5 million smallest businesses and would be introduced from April 2020, providing medium and large engagers 18 months to prepare.\r\n\r\nThis is about making sure the right tax is paid from 2020 onwards. HMRC will only use information resulting from these changes to open a new enquiry into earlier years if there is reason to suspect fraud or criminal behaviour. Contractors who are following the existing rules will feel little impact, and the off-payroll working rules do not affect the self-employed. No-one will be prevented from working through a company if it suits them.\r\n\r\nSupport for Business\r\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) are working hard to ensure that everyone affected by the change can access the support they need to get it right.  Since Budget 2018 HMRC have \r\n\u2022\tpublished information on the detailed design of the reform in response to a 12 week consultation;\r\n\u2022\tpublished draft legislation and published detailed guidance on how businesses and intermediaries can prepare for the change and set up dedicated teams to provide education and training;\r\n \r\nAhead of implementation, HMRC are also:\r\n\u2022\toffering one-to-one support to more than 2,000 of the UK\u2019s biggest employers;\r\n\u2022\twriting to all medium-sized businesses;\r\n\u2022\t providing workshops, online learning, round tables, online learning; \r\n\r\nFinally, HMRC are also making enhancements to the online Check Employment Status for Tax (CEST) tool to make it more user-friendly in response to stakeholder feedback. \r\n\r\nHMRC are encouraging engagers to use the existing CEST, and they will stand by the decisions it makes. For the more complex cases, customers are able to access detailed guidance or call HMRC\u2019s dedicated helpline for one-to-one support.\r\n\r\nThe Government values the contribution of flexible workers to the UK economy, but it is also under an obligation to ensure fairness between individuals who work in a similar way.\r\n\r\n\r\nHM Treasury",

Apart from a small number of end-of-series derogations, all new registrations of M1SP vehicles must comply. \r\n\r\nIt is right that vehicles with high CO2 emissions pay greater first year VED than those with lower emissions. Only motorhomes with the very highest emissions will fall into the highest tax band and only brand-new vehicles are impacted. \r\n\r\nBudget 2015 announced a reformed VED system which was introduced for light passenger vehicles, including motorhomes, with a recorded CO2 emissions figure from 1 April 2017.

The EU Regulation includes a derogation from stunning for religious slaughter and also allows individual Member States to impose stricter national rules for religious slaughter.\r\n\r\nIn England, The Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (England) Regulations 2015 (WATOK) enforce the EU requirements and contain stricter national rules that apply when animals are slaughtered by either the Jewish or Muslim method.\r\n\r\nNational regulations on religious slaughter have a long history. Religious slaughter was first debated in Parliament in 1875. The Slaughter of Animals Act 1933 introduced a legal requirement for stunning of animals prior to slaughter, and contained an exemption where animals were slaughtered for specific religious communities. Over the years, the rules governing religious slaughter have developed to provide additional protection for animals slaughtered in accordance with religious rites and have maintained the long standing exception for Jews and Muslims to eat meat prepared in accordance with their religious beliefs.\r\n\r\nUnder the Withdrawal Act 2018 EU legislation on welfare at slaughter will become domestic legislation alongside WATOK once we leave the EU.  \r\n\r\nAnimal welfare requirements are monitored and enforced by Official Veterinarians of the Food Standards Agency to ensure that animals are spared unnecessary pain, suffering or distress during the slaughter process.\r\n\r\nThe Government delivered its manifesto commitment last year by introducing regulations requiring the mandatory use of CCTV in all slaughterhouses in England.  This will assist Official Veterinarians of the Food Standards Agency to maintain and improve standards of animal welfare in slaughterhouses.\r\n\r\nThe Government is aware that there is public concern about meat from animals being slaughtered in accordance with religious beliefs being sold to consumers who do not require their meat to be prepared in this way and that there are calls for such meat to be labelled.  \r\n\r\nThe Government is actively engaging with religious communities and other stakeholders on issues around religious slaughter.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\r\n\r\n",

                    "summary": "Adrenaline pens should be carried at all times. Back-up pens in public places could be a safety net but significant safeguards would be required. The government will look into the feasibility of this.",
                    "details": "Adrenaline auto-injectors, commonly known as adrenaline pens, are intended for self-administration by a patient or carer, to treat anaphylaxis at the onset of symptoms. Anaphylaxis can progress rapidly and may result in death before emergency medical help has arrived. The sooner anaphylaxis is treated the more chance a patient has of a successful outcome.  \r\n\r\nEpipen is one brand of adrenaline pen available in the UK, other brands include Jext and Emerade. \r\n\r\nA person at risk of anaphylaxis is recommended to carry two adrenaline pens at all times as sometimes one injection is not enough. Even if a patient responds to their own adrenaline pens, emergency medical help must always be summoned because the patient may deteriorate later on. It is therefore important for them to be supervised in hospital during the recovery period. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises there may be situations where back-up adrenaline pens could be life-saving, for example where someone is not carrying adrenaline and is inadvertently exposed to a known allergen, or if they were to react to a previously unknown allergen. \r\n\r\nHowever, any consideration of the benefit of back-up adrenaline pens in public places must be balanced against the risks. Serious harm could arise if adrenaline were to be administered inappropriately to someone who had collapsed for reasons other than anaphylaxis, such as an electrical disturbance of the heart. \r\n\r\nIn considering provision of adrenaline pens in public places, one must also consider the need for significant safeguards. Adrenaline pens do not offer a way to tell whether a patient has collapsed due to anaphylaxis, nor is it obvious to an untrained person how to administer them safely in an emergency. Therefore, training in the recognition and management of anaphylaxis and the correct administration technique would be needed to ensure the safe and effective use of adrenaline pens by individuals without medical training. \r\nThe situation for defibrillators is somewhat different as modern defibrillators can determine, from the electrical activity detected, whether a shock should be delivered to the heart and if so, the defibrillator will deliver it at the appropriate point in the electrical cycle. This removes the responsibility from members of the public to make an appropriate diagnosis. \r\n\r\nThe adrenaline pens would also need to be stored correctly and securely.  Adrenaline breaks down quickly especially at high temperatures and at low temperatures the pens\u2019 release mechanisms may not work as they should.  This means that they would need to be kept indoors and away from extremes of temperatures.  Expiry dates of pens would also need to be checked on a regular basis so that pens close to expiry were replaced with fresh pens.  This is essential to ensure that the pens will be reliable. Security of storage would be another important consideration. For these reasons the Government had previously concluded that it would not be feasible to make adrenaline pens widely available alongside defibrillators.\r\n\r\nAdrenaline pens are normally supplied against a prescription for an individual patient. However, in 2017 the UK government changed its medicines legislation to allow schools to obtain back-up adrenaline pens not issued against a prescription, for use in an emergency to treat anaphylaxis. This was accompanied by detailed guidance to provide a framework for training of school personnel in the safe and effective use of the back-up adrenaline pens. The legislation is presently restricted to schools, or educational establishments that would fall into the category of schools as defined in legislation. \r\n\r\nThe Government recently re-opened its consideration of wider availability to investigate whether the provision for schools to hold back-up adrenaline pens without a prescription could be extended to eating places and other establishments. This will be informed by the experience of wider availability elsewhere, as in Ireland where accredited training courses are linked to legislation on the supply of adrenaline pens without a prescription as a means to ensure that individuals or organisations are suitably qualified to hold and administer adrenaline pens safely and effectively.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, the UK government will undertake a timely and thorough investigation into the possibility of making adrenaline pens available in public eating places and other establishments and in doing so will consult clinical and technical experts for their views. If the outcome is that the benefit of wider availability of adrenaline pens is considered to outweigh the risks, and appropriate safeguards can be put in place, the Government would look to implement further amendments to the medicines legislation in order to enable this.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

                    "details": "The Government continues to be committed to phasing out the use of peat in horticulture in England by 2030. In 2011, we set a voluntary target to phase out the use of horticultural peat in the amateur sector by 2020, and the professional sector by 2030. This commitment was reconfirmed in the 25 Year Environment Plan (25 YEP), and while some progress has been made towards this goal, we also stated in the 25 YEP that if we have not seen sufficient movement to peat alternatives by 2020, then we would take further measures.\r\n\r\nWhile some key players in the industry have been rising to the challenge, and there have been examples of some good progress to date, discussions since 2016 suggests that progress had stalled and the voluntary target approach has not made as much progress as hoped. We are currently developing further measures and will set out our plans in the forthcoming England Peat Strategy. \r\n\r\nCommercial extraction of peat in England is licenced on approximately 627 ha of peatland across 24 sites (representing <0.1% of the peat area of England). The National Planning Policy Framework, first published in 2012, ends the granting of new licences for peat extraction. Therefore, peat extraction in England will end when the remaining licences come to an end. This is 2042 at the latest, although discussions suggests that it will be earlier than this. \r\n\r\nTwo thirds of the peat sold in the UK is imported from Europe, so it is also important that we focus on reducing demand for peat in horticulture to protect peatland outside of the UK. \r\n\r\nWe are working with the industry to make the transition to peat alternatives and to overcome the barriers to their use. For example, we are jointly funding research with the industry to overcome barriers to peat replacement in professional horticulture. This \u00a31 million project will end in December and has shown promising results, and will culminate in a growers\u2019 conference in early 2020. The project is co-funded by the Agricultural and Horticulture Development Board, growing media manufacturers and commercial growers. It is being undertaken by ADAS and the Quadram Institute and involves commercial scale trails hosted by commercial growers.\r\n\r\nWe have also worked with the industry to develop a Responsible Sourcing Scheme for Growing Media which allows manufacturers and retailers to make informed choices on growing media ingredients, launched in September. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",

                    "details": "Every year, councils issue nearly 24 million council tax bills to help fund key local services, from adult social care and children\u2019s services, to refuse collections and leisure facilities. Uncollected tax means less money for services and higher bills for residents who do pay on time. \r\n\r\nHowever, imprisonment should only ever be the last resort for non-payment of council tax. Local authorities should consider carefully the reasons for non-payment before seeking a committal warrant from the magistrates\u2019 court, which can only issue a warrant if it is satisfied that the reason for non-payment is wilful refusal or culpable neglect. Committal is not appropriate unless the court is satisfied that the reason for non-payment meets these strict tests.\r\n\r\nAs the Local Government Minister announced in April this year, the Government wants to bring in a more effective council tax collection system which treats people more fairly, while ensuring the money required to fund public services is collected. It recognises consideration of personal circumstances can help a person\u2019s financial recovery.  The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has been engaging with charities, debt advice organisations and local authorities to gather evidence on current practice and on possible changes to improve council tax collection.\r\n\r\nThere all already a wide range of discounts and exemptions to help people who might otherwise struggle to pay. In particular, every local authority must have a council tax reduction scheme to provide support to people who might otherwise have difficulty paying their bill. As a result, many householders either receive a greatly reduced bill or, for example in the case of pensioners with limited savings, do not need to pay any council tax at all.    \r\n\r\nThere is a well-established process in place that councils should follow when residents fall behind with their instalments. The Government has published guidance for local authorities to follow when they are taking action to collect council tax arrears. This guidance highlights the importance of authorities being sympathetic to those in genuine hardship. \r\n\r\nWhen a payment is missed, authorities issue a reminder notice to encourage the resident to contact them and agree a repayment plan. If the authority is not contacted, they will send a final reminder. If there is no response to the final reminder and the council is not able to agree a repayment plan, they will then consider issuing a court summons. The court hearing gives residents an opportunity to respond to the council if they believe that there has been an error in the calculation of the bill. If the court decides that the resident is liable for the bill and a repayment plan is still not agreed, it will issue a liability order. This order provides authorities with a range of options that they can use to clear the debt. These options include applying for orders that allow deductions to be made from a resident\u2019s income and referring the case to enforcement agents. \r\n\r\nBefore authorities can consider applying to commit an individual to prison, they must first exhaust the option of using enforcement agents to try to recover the debt. This would involve the agent attempting to contact the resident and put in place a repayment plan or to take control of goods that can be sold to repay the debt. Throughout this whole process, including when enforcement agents are engaged with the resident, authorities should be willing to negotiate a repayment plan. In the most recent period for which figures are available (2017-18), 34 committal orders were issued as a result of proceedings for non-payment of council tax. \r\n\r\nMore generally, everyone must pay their fair share of tax, regardless of wealth and status and no one is above the law. HMRC\u2019s criminal investigation policy is published on GOV.UK. HMRC do not take an individual\u2019s wealth or background into account deciding whether to pass a criminal investigation to the Crown Prosecution Service. HMRC has specifically built its capability to triple its prosecutions of the most serious and complex tax frauds since Summer Budget 2015 and currently has over 300 wealthy individuals either under criminal investigation, at trial or undergoing confiscation proceedings.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

                    "details": "Bovine TB (BTB) is one of the most difficult and intractable animal health challenges that England faces today. It is a slow moving and insidious disease which leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year with breeders suffering the loss of valued herds thereby creating considerable trauma in the farming industry. Government spends about \u00a3100 million a year on disease control in England with the cost to industry estimated to be a further \u00a350 million. Herd breakdowns also have major consequences for the welfare and well-being of farmers and their families.\r\n\r\nOur 25-year strategy to eradicate BTB, published in 2014, is founded in science. It establishes a range of measures to control the disease and protect the future of our livestock industries. The cornerstone of our strategy is a policy of regular testing and removal of infected cattle from herds. We have incrementally introduced tougher restrictions on cattle movements from herds at risk of infection and more sensitive tests. We have also encouraged effective biosecurity on-farm and introduced measures to encourage more effective risk management and more information for cattle farmers. \r\n\r\nAs part of our approach, a policy of badger control has been rolled out in many parts of the High Risk Area in the south-west and west of England; there is no example of a country that has successfully eradicated BTB without also addressing the presence of the disease in wildlife. The latest independent, peer-reviewed academic study into the effectiveness of badger culling (Downs et al. (2019) Nature Scientific Reports) showed a statistically significant decline in BTB herd incidence in the first two cull areas: a 66% reduction in TB incidence rates in the Gloucestershire cull area and a 37% reduction in the Somerset cull area over the four years of intensive badger culling, relative to similar comparison areas where no culling took place.\r\n\r\nHowever, the badger is an iconic, protected species and no one wants to be culling badgers forever. That is why, five years into the current strategy, the government asked Professor Sir Charles Godfray to review progress and consider what additional actions might be necessary now to ensure other tools and interventions are ready to be deployed in later phases of the strategy. Sir Charles\u2019s report is available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-strategy-for-achieving-bovine-tuberculosis-free-status-for-england-2018-review. \r\n\r\nThe report makes clear that there are no easy answers to reducing disease levels. It confirms that badgers do transmit BTB to cattle and contribute to the persistence of the disease. However, it also stresses that moving from lethal to non-lethal control of the disease in badgers is highly desirable. In addition, Sir Charles\u2019s report recommends: improving the efficacy of our testing regime so that we are able to detect the presence of the disease earlier and remove it from cattle herds faster; enhancing on-farm controls, biosecurity and safe trading practices to stop the disease spreading; and addressing major research priorities, including those in the field of cattle vaccination.\r\n\r\nSir Charles\u2019s review concluded in October 2018. Our response will be published shortly, setting out the next steps the government intends to take and how our policy will continue to evolve. There will never be a single answer to tackling the scourge of BTB, but by deploying a range of policy interventions, informed by Sir Charles\u2019s important contribution, we can turn the tide on this terrible disease and achieve our long-term goal of eradicating it by 2038.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.",

                    "details": "The Government has no plans to lower the voting age, having been elected on a manifesto commitment to retain the current franchise for parliamentary elections at 18. An individual below the age of 18 is treated as a minor in both the foster care system and the criminal justice system. Such an individual cannot buy alcohol or cigarettes. Full citizenship rights, including voting, should be gained at adulthood. The issue of lowering the voting age has been debated frequently and most recently it has been defeated in the House of Commons in 2005, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\r\n\r\nThe age of 18 is recognised in the vast majority of democratic countries as the age at which an individual becomes an adult. Accordingly, the vast majority of liberal democracies worldwide consider 18 the right age to enfranchise young people. This includes the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and almost all European Union countries.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that young people are able to do certain things at the ages of 16 and 17, full citizenship rights are not accrued until an individual reaches their 18th birthday. For example, citizens are not called upon to participate in jury service until the age of 18 or above. Those under the age of 18 also require parental consent in order to join the armed forces reserves. Young people in the reserves cannot be sent into action before the age of 18.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that young people wish to be involved in the political process and believes it important that children and young people feel engaged in decision making. To encourage this, the Government has launched the Parliamentarian Youth Engagement Toolkit in 2018 as well as a secondary School\u2019s Resource in autumn 2018. The Government has also delivered a suite of activity focused on promoting democratic engagement among young people across the UK. In particular, the Government has funded Young Citizens to deliver the Democracy Ambassadors scheme and recruit 1,000 young people as Democracy Ambassadors across England. The Government has also provided funding for the UK Youth Parliament, Youth Select Committee and Make Your Mark ballot which support young people between 11-18 years old to raise issues on local and national levels and get involved in democracy.\r\n\r\nIn 2018 the Government launched the inaugural National Democracy Week which convenes civil society organisations such as UK Youth, Elevation Networks and Patchwork Foundation to deliver targeted democratic engagement activity. The second National Democracy Week took place between 14-20 October 2019.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office",

                    "summary": "The Government is committed to greening our economy and designed the changes for energy-saving materials to retain as much of the VAT relief as possible for UK households, while complying with EU law.",
                    "details": "Under UK VAT rules, most goods and services are subject to VAT at 20 per cent. There are some reliefs but these are strictly limited under EU law. One such relief is the 5 per cent reduced rate for the installation of certain energy-saving materials such as insulation, solar panels, and other technologies in residential accommodation. This VAT relief aims to lower the cost for consumers and families of installing these energy-saving materials in their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, the European Commission launched infraction proceedings against the UK, arguing that the scope of the UK\u2019s reduced rate for energy-saving materials was too wide. The Government did not agree with the infraction and the matter was subsequently referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union. In 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union agreed with the European Commission and found that the scope of the UK\u2019s reduced rate for energy-saving materials was too wide. \r\n\r\nThe Government held a public consultation on proposed changes to the reduced rate. This included proposals to remove the VAT relief from the installation of solar panels entirely. This would have potentially affected 40,000 installations per year and had a significant impact on those wishing to invest in sustainable energy solutions.\r\n\r\nFollowing a consultation on the proposed changes in 2016, the Government recognised the concerns of consumers and industry and following further discussions with the European Commission reached agreement to scale back the changes. This means that as much of the VAT relief as possible will be retained for UK households, while complying with EU law. \r\n\r\nThe amendments will:\r\n\u2022\tMaintain the reduced rate on all installations of energy-saving materials for recipients who are aged 60 or over, or on certain benefits, for relevant housing associations, and where the installations are in buildings used for relevant residential purposes such as care homes and children\u2019s homes;\r\n\u2022\tRemove the reduced rate for the installation of wind and water turbines; and\r\n\u2022\tMaintain the reduced rate for all other installations of energy-saving materials in residential accommodation where the cost of the materials does not exceed 60 per cent of the total cost of the installation. \r\nThe changes will take effect from 1 October 2019.\r\n\r\nHMRC consulted on the technical detail of the changes in April 2019. While recognising that industry groups wished for the relief to be maintained in full, there was acknowledgement that the Government is required to make the changes under EU law.\r\n\r\nThe Government does not expect the changes to have a significant impact on the industry or consumers wishing to install energy-saving materials in their homes. Around 1,500 future installations of solar panels, energy-saving boilers and wind turbines are expected to be affected annually, plus some other smaller scale items.  This represents less than 5 per cent of the value of all installations currently eligible for the reduced rate.\r\n\r\nIt is important to be clear that this action is the result of the requirement to apply EU law. While the UK remains a member of the EU, the Government is obliged to make these changes. However, the Government remains committed to greening the UK economy. As all taxes are kept under review, it may be possible to amend these rules once the UK has left the EU. \r\n\r\nHM Treasury.",
