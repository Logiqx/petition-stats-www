However, close to three quarters of the electorate took part in the 2016 referendum, trusting that the result would be respected. This Government wrote to every household prior to the referendum, promising that the outcome of the referendum would be implemented. 17.4 million people then voted to leave the European Union, providing the biggest democratic mandate for any course of action ever directed at UK Government. \r\n\r\nBritish people cast their votes once again in the 2017 General Election where over 80% of those who voted, voted for parties, including the Opposition, who committed in their manifestos to upholding the result of the referendum. \r\n\r\nThis Government stands by this commitment. \r\n\r\nRevoking Article 50 would break the promises made by Government to the British people, disrespect the clear instruction from a democratic vote, and in turn, reduce confidence in our democracy.

This agreement secures the rights of more than three million EU citizens living in the UK and around one million UK nationals living in the EU; and sets out the terms of the time-limited implementation period which will provide our businesses and citizens with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe financial settlement represents a fair settlement of our obligations as a departing member state and was agreed in the context of the implementation period and our future relationship. This agreement confirms that the days of sending vast payments to the EU are coming to an end. \r\n\r\nIt also means we will be able to spend more of taxpayers\u2019 money on our priorities, such as the extra investment we are putting into our NHS. \r\n\r\nOn Northern Ireland, the agreed Protocol guarantees that even in the unlikely event that the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and no customs border down the Irish Sea. \r\n\r\nThe agreement preserves the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom, upholds the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, and ensures people and businesses that rely on an open border between the Northern Ireland and Ireland can continue living their lives and operating as they do now.\r\n\r\nAs set out in the Political Declaration, once we have left the EU and for the first time in more than four decades, the UK will have an independent trade policy. The UK will be free to negotiate, sign, and ratify trade deals during the implementation period and bring them into force after the period has finished. \r\n\r\nThe deal we have reached is the right deal for the UK. It takes back control of our borders, our laws and our money while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of the UK. Anything other than straightforward approval of the deal will bring with it uncertainty for the economy, for business, and for citizens.\r\n\r\nNeither Parliament nor the Government want a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario.

                    "details": "Fireworks have played a part in the UK\u2019s history, and have been used for celebrations by many of our cultures \u2013 Christian, Hindu, Muslim - for many years. We recognise the enjoyment they bring to many people and the important role that they play in bringing communities together in celebration or remembrance.  Private displays allow families and friends to hold their own displays and create their own traditions, celebrating events throughout the year such as weddings and birthdays. However, there is a limit on when fireworks can be set off, with a nightly curfew after 11pm every day apart from the four traditional dates, when that curfew is extended.  \r\n\r\nThe Government understands the strong feelings that many people have about fireworks. But we would like to reassure you that there is already strict legislation in place to regulate the supply, storage, possession, use and misuse of fireworks to ensure public safety. This includes powers to prosecute those who use them in a dangerous or antisocial manner.\r\n\r\nTogether, the restrictions set out in the 2003 Fireworks Act, the Fireworks Regulations 2004 and the Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015, provide a regulatory framework that allows for the safe enjoyment of fireworks by the public while minimising the risk of fireworks harming individuals, property or animals. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the availability of fireworks to the public is restricted by a licensing scheme for retailers which only allows for their sale without a license during the traditional firework periods of November 5th, New Year\u2019s Eve, Diwali and the Chinese New Year.  There are also age restrictions in place which prevent the sale of fireworks to those under the age of 16 or 18 dependent on the classification of firework.  There are further restrictions on the public possession of most fireworks by those under 18.\r\n\r\nLocal Authority Trading Standards have powers to take action against those who sell fireworks illegally, including those selling fireworks without an appropriate licence, or outside the normal selling period, or to underage people. This also includes the sale of illegally imported fireworks and internet sales.\r\nWe recognise that the noise from fireworks can be distressing to some people and so there is in place a noise level limit of 120 decibels on fireworks that are available for consumer use.  Consumers can also choose to buy from the wide range of low noise fireworks now available. \r\n\r\nThe Government is also aware of concerns about the risks of firework-related injury. Measures have already been taken to ban certain dangerous items from sale in the UK including bangers and jumping jacks.  This removes from sale higher risk fireworks which could lead to injury. Also, the most powerful category of display fireworks must not be sold to members of the public. \r\n\r\nHaving said that legislation is in place, we have listened to the concerns around the potential for distress to be caused by fireworks to individuals, as well as to livestock, pets and wildlife. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the best way to continue to reduce any distress caused by fireworks is to work with industry, retailers and others to promote their safe and responsible use through guidance and public education and to ensure that appropriate action is taken against those that break the rules.\r\n\r\nThat is why the new Office for Product Safety and Standards is working with industry, retailers, charities and others, including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and Netmums, to promote their safe and responsible use and to raise consumer awareness on firework safety. \r\n\r\nThe Government urges those using fireworks to be considerate to their neighbours and to give sufficient notice of firework use, particularly to those who are vulnerable such as the elderly, children, those with mental health issues such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and those with pets and livestock. Government-sponsored guidance on safe and considerate use of fireworks is available via the GOV.UK website.  This includes a link to the Fireworks Code hosted by RoSPA containing guidance on respecting neighbours, especially those with pets and informing them of planned displays.  In addition, the Government supports the Blue Cross animal charity guidance which advises how to avoid or reduce stress to animals when fireworks are being set off. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the Kennel Club and the Dogs Trust provide similar advice on their websites concerning how to minimise the impact of fireworks use on animals.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes the legislation and guidance already in place is appropriate to allow for the safe use of fireworks by the public; therefore, we have no plans to ban private sales.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy",

Since then, this Government has remained committed to honouring that instruction, given to us through 17.4 million votes to leave the European Union - the highest number of votes cast for anything in UK electoral history. \r\n\r\nThat result was reinforced not only by Parliament\u2019s passing of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill with clear and convincing majorities; but also in the 2017 General Election, where over 80% of people also voted for parties committed to respecting the result of the referendum. In fact, both major parties stood for election on a stated policy to respect the decision of the people. The Government is clear that it is now its duty to implement the will expressed by voters in the referendum - respecting both the will of the British people, and the democratic process which delivered the referendum result.\r\n\r\nThe British people must be able to trust in its Government both to effect their will, and to deliver the best outcome for them. As the Prime Minister has said: \u201cThis is about more than the decision to leave the EU; it is about whether the public can trust their politicians to put in place the decision they took.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Government therefore remains committed to delivering on the instruction and the mandate given to us by the British people - to withdraw from the European Union.

                    "details": "This was a deeply tragic case and our sympathies remain with Violet-Grace\u2019s family. No sentence can make up for the loss of a loved one but we are focused on getting the law right, to ensure the changes we make are comprehensive, proportionate and, we hope, might help avoid some further unnecessary deaths on our roads.\r\n\r\nIn October 2017 we published the government response to the consultation on driving offences and penalties relating to causing death or serious injury and confirmed proposals to: increase the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving from 14 years\u2019 imprisonment to life; increase the maximum penalty for causing death by careless driving under the influence of drink or drugs from 14 years\u2019 imprisonment to life; and create a new offence of causing serious injury by careless driving. Increasing the maximum penalty to life will enable the courts to impose a life sentence or any lesser sentence, including a determinate sentence of any length.\r\n\r\nMinimum sentences are rarely used in criminal law in England and Wales. To allow judges to take into account all circumstances of the case, the normal practice is for Parliament to set maximum penalties and for the courts to determine the appropriate sentence, having regard to the facts of an individual case.  This is why our sentencing framework generally sets maximum penalties but not minimum penalties, and even where a minimum sentence is introduced the court retains a discretion not to impose the sentence where it would be unjust to do so in a particular case. \r\n\r\nWhile we recognise the very great harm caused by dangerous drivers who are responsible for multiple deaths or injury, it is a general principle of law that sentences are imposed to be served concurrently when they relate to the same course of events and consecutively when they relate to separate incidents.  However, the death of more than one victim as a result of the offence is an aggravating factor the courts take into account in determining the length of sentence to impose.\r\n\r\nWe will bring forward proposals for reform of the law as soon as parliamentary time allows.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice",

                    "details": "Uncontrolled migration erodes public confidence, damages economies, and places those on the move in situations of intense vulnerability. The UK is taking significant steps to tackle uncontrolled migration by:\r\n\r\n- Addressing the root causes of migration, through our targeted assistance for livelihoods, healthcare, education and economic development \r\n- Tackling modern slavery and organised immigration crime\r\n- Supporting enhanced border management\r\n- Providing critical humanitarian support and protection for vulnerable migrants, as well as offering voluntary return and vital reintegration support to those wishing to return home\r\n- Supporting refugees to stay in a first safe country through our humanitarian and development work in Africa, the Middle East and Asia\r\n\r\nThe Global Compact for Migration embeds these efforts within the global system, enhances cooperation between states, and sets out ways that countries may choose to deliver these objectives.\r\n\r\nThe Compact is not legally binding. It creates a framework to allow countries to work together to make global migration more beneficial for everyone.\r\n\r\nIt respects the sovereignty of all states to decide who enters their territory. It will not affect our ability to determine and implement our own migration policies, including in areas such as asylum, border controls and returns of illegal migrants.\r\n\r\nIt does not establish a \u2018human right to migrate\u2019 or create any new legal categories of migrant. It explicitly stresses that migrants are entitled to the same universal human rights as any human being, and that these are different to the legal protections available to refugees.\r\n\r\nToo many people, including vulnerable women and girls, are taking risky journeys to migrate through dangerous channels. The Compact will help us take important steps to keep migrants around the world safer and to protect the most vulnerable, by supporting international cooperation on the protection of migrants, in line with our obligations under international law. It outlines ways of preventing exploitation, and of combating the heinous crime of modern slavery.\r\n\r\nA key objective of the document is to support cooperation on reducing uncontrolled migration. It sets out the responsibility of countries of origin to ensure effective control of their borders, and to cooperate in accepting the return of their nationals when they no longer have the right to remain in another country. Furthermore, the text also calls on countries of origin to work with the international community to address the drivers of irregular migration, by creating economic opportunities for populations in source countries, and improving governance and respect for the rule of law.\r\n\r\nWhen migration is safe and regular, it can bring great prosperity. The Compact also sets out possible actions to harness the economic benefits of safer, regular migration, for example by reducing the costs of remittances that migrants send home. These can foster economic development in source countries, helping to address some of the causes of migration.\r\n\r\nThe Compact is the result of months of intergovernmental negotiations. Though it is legally non-binding and no country can be compelled to conform with its provisions, we are aware that a small number of countries have chosen not to endorse it. We respect this choice and note that countries will be able to endorse the Compact, or cooperate with other states on delivering its objectives, at any point in the future. \r\n\r\nDepartment for International Development",

                    "summary": "As primary educators, parents must be consulted on their school\u2019s curriculum for Relationships, and Relationships and Sex Education and may request their child\u2019s withdrawal from Sex Education.",
                    "details": "Today\u2019s children and young people are growing up in an increasingly complex world, living their lives seamlessly on and offline. This presents many positive opportunities, but also challenges and risks. Pupils need to know how to be safe and healthy, and how to manage their academic, personal and social lives in a positive way. \r\n\r\nThis is why we are making Relationships Education compulsory in all primary schools in England, Relationships and Sex Education compulsory in all secondary schools, and Health Education compulsory in all state-funded schools.\r\n\r\nWe are clear that parents and carers are the prime teachers for children on many of these matters. Schools complement and reinforce this role, and have told us that they see building on what pupils learn at home as an important part of delivering a good education.\r\n\r\nWe are proposing that schools will be required (as set out in draft regulations) to consult with parents on their Relationships Education and RSE policy, which will help minimise any misconception about the subjects and enable parents to decide whether to request that their child is withdrawn from sex education.  Schools should engage proactively with parents, to set out how and when they plan to cover topics included in Relationships Education and RSE so that parents can understand clearly what is going to be taught.\r\n\r\nSchools are free to decide on teaching materials, as they do for other curriculum areas, but should assess each resource carefully to ensure that it is appropriate for the age and maturity of pupils, and sensitive to their needs. Schools should also ensure that, when they consult with parents, they provide examples of the resources that they plan to use as this can be reassuring for parents, and enables them to continue the conversations started in class at home as well as to communicate where they may have concerns.\r\n\r\nSchools will be required to take into account the religious backgrounds of their pupils, and schools with a religious character can build on the core content by reflecting on the teachings of their faith. All schools must comply with the relevant provisions of the Equality Act (2010).\r\n\r\nThe draft guidance advises head teachers that parents can request that their child be withdrawn from sex education as part of RSE and unless there are exceptional circumstances, they should agree the parents\u2019 request until 3 terms before the child turns 16. At that point, if the child wishes to receive sex education, they should be provided with it in one of those three terms. In line with the current position, there will be no right to withdraw from sex education taught in the science national curriculum.\r\n\r\nGood practice is also likely to include the headteacher discussing with the parents any detrimental effects that withdrawal might have on the child, including any social and emotional effects of being excluded e.g. receiving information from peers or from the internet. We believe that the new framework is the best way to secure the proper balance between parents\u2019 rights and the rights of young people once they are competent to make their own choices.\r\n\r\nIn primary schools, we want the subjects to put in place the key building blocks of healthy, respectful relationships, focusing on family and friendships, both on and offline. At secondary, teaching will introduce age-appropriate knowledge about intimate relationships, including marriage and other forms of committed relationships, and sex. \r\n\r\nPrimary schools are not required to teach sex education but where they do cover elements of sex education other than those taught within the science national curriculum, this must be included in the school\u2019s policy, which is subject to consultation with parents. This will make clear that all requests from parents to withdraw their child from sex education at primary will be automatically granted.\r\n\r\nTeaching on mental wellbeing is central to Health Education, reflecting that a priority for parents is their children\u2019s happiness. The new subject content will give pupils the knowledge and capability to take care of themselves and get support if problems arise. This also provides the opportunity to teach about physical health and activity, basic first aid and life-saving skills, and drugs and alcohol.\r\n\r\nOur guiding principles have been that the compulsory subject content must be age appropriate. It must be taught sensitively and inclusively, with respect for the backgrounds and beliefs of pupils and parents while always with the aim of providing pupils with the knowledge they need of the law.\r\n\r\nThese subjects represent a huge opportunity to help our children and young people develop, to treat each other with kindness, respect and integrity, in order to become successful and happy adults who make a meaningful contribution to our society.\r\n\r\nDraft guidance/regulations are still available here: https://consult.education.gov.uk/pshe/relationships-education-rse-health-education/\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

The total core schools and high needs budget will rise from almost \u00a341bn in 2017-18 to \u00a343.5bn by 2019-20.  \r\n\r\nFigures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies show that in 2020, per pupil funding for five to sixteen year olds, adjusted for inflation, will be 50% higher than in 2000, and 70% higher than in 1990. We can also compare ourselves favourably to other countries \u2013 we spend as much per pupil on state school education as any major economy in the world, with the single exception of the United States of America.  \r\n\r\nWe are also distributing that funding more fairly, through the national funding formula which directs money to where it is most needed, based on schools\u2019 and pupils\u2019 needs and characteristics \u2013 not accidents of geography or past arrangements. Since 2017, the national funding formula has allocated every local authority more money for every pupil in every school, while allocating the largest increases to the schools that have been most underfunded. \r\n\r\nWe recently confirmed funding allocations for local authorities through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for 2019-20. More information on the DSG and a detailed breakdown of funding allocations for each local authority is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2019-to-2020 \r\n\r\nWe also announced that we will provide \u00a3250m additional funding for high needs over this financial year and the next.

We recognise that the high needs budget faces significant pressures and this additional expenditure will help to manage those pressures. \r\n\r\nSpending plans beyond 2019-20 will be set at the next Spending Review and naturally we cannot pre-empt these decisions \u2013 but we are of course committed to securing the right deal for education. \r\n\r\nDespite all of this, we do recognise that budgets remain tight. That is why we are supporting schools and head teachers to make the most of their budgets and reduce costs on things like energy, water bills and materials.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

                    "details": "The Government takes the possession of knives extremely seriously. We understand the devastating impact knife crime has on victims and their families, and are determined to put a stop to violent crimes that involve knives. \r\n\r\nParliament has provided a sentencing framework which give courts the powers they need to effectively deal with the range of offences and offenders which come before them. Where someone is actually harmed by a knife or offensive weapon, there are a range of offences that the person may be charged with, such as causing grievous bodily harm. These can result in lengthy sentences up to life imprisonment. In England and Wales in fact, all murder convictions must result in a life sentence. For offenders aged 18 and over who bring a knife or another weapon to the scene of a murder with the intention of using it, courts will consider a minimum term spent in custody of at least 25 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, we introduced minimum custodial sentences for repeat knife possession and offences that involve threatening with a weapon. Adults face a minimum of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment whilst young people aged 16 or 17 face a minimum 4 month Detention and Training Order. Since the introduction of the minimum custodial term people caught carrying a knife or offensive weapon for a second time are now more likely than ever before to go to prison \u2013 in the year ending September 2018, 82% of offenders received a custodial sentence for repeat possession offences. These offences carry maximum terms of 4 years\u2019 imprisonment.\r\n\r\nWhen sentencing, the courts consider the full circumstances of the offence and offender and must follow any relevant sentencing guidelines produced by the independent Sentencing Council. The guidelines are clear that for any offence the use of weapon will be treated as an aggravating factor meriting an increased sentence. \r\n\r\nIt is clear tackling serious violence requires a response on several fronts. This Government is taking significant action to both prevent and respond to crimes involving weapons through the Serious Violence Strategy, published on 9 April 2018. The Strategy sets out 61 commitments the Government will be taking forward to tackle violent crime. For example, the Offensive Weapons Bill, currently before Parliament includes provision for new offences related to knives, such as preventing the delivery of knives to home addresses when bought online. The Strategy also commits to strengthen police capability to act against violent crime, and to secure better partnership working to support young people and encourage them to take up positive activities rather than get involved in crime.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice.",

Cats and dogs become members of the family and it is a great source of worry and uncertainty when they are injured or lost. The Government encourages veterinary practices and rehoming centres to scan cats and dogs brought to their premises so that their owners can be identified. In cases of road traffic accidents, we encourage local authorities to identify the owners where possible. \r\n\r\nWe welcome the move by many local authorities to include a requirement in street cleaning contracts to scan pets found on the road for a microchip. All local authorities should already be in possession of handheld microchip scanners as they are required to enforce dog microchipping controls. In addition, Rule 286 of The Highway Code advises drivers to report any accident involving an animal to the police, which we hope would lead to their owners being made aware of the incident. \r\n\r\nIt is compulsory for all dogs to be microchipped in Great Britain and this enables stray dogs to be quickly reunited with their owners. Compulsory microchipping for dogs was introduced because of the particular public safety risk posed by stray dogs. The same risk is not associated with stray cats. Local authorities have powers to enforce the dog microchipping controls and in relation to stray dogs which means that all local authorities should already be in possession of handheld microchip scanners. \r\n\r\nThe Government strongly recommends cat owners get their cat microchipped and keep their records up to date. We support cat charities\u2019 microchipping campaigns and the statutory Code of Practice for the Welfare of Cats, made under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, contains advice about identifying cats including by use of a microchip. \r\n\r\nWhilst microchipping cats is good for their welfare, and it is important to publicise those benefits, lost and stray cats do not pose the same public safety risk as dogs, and therefore making cat microchipping compulsory is not considered necessary at this time.  We will continue to work, therefore, with the relevant stakeholders to stress the importance of cat microchipping, and the scanning of stray or lost pets. \r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",

The Government fully supports the approach that NICE and NHS England are adopting.\r\n\r\nNICE was established nearly two decades ago to act as the authoritative, independent, expert body for assessing the clinical and cost effectiveness of new drug treatments in this country. It is internationally respected and central to decisions about which treatments can be reimbursed on the NHS. \r\n\r\nWhilst the Government understands the high level of interest in Orkambi, there is no justification for treating Vertex differently from the numerous other companies that engage with NICE, and the NICE appraisal process is both suitable and appropriate for evaluating the evidence Vertex have provided for their products.\r\n\r\nWe were disappointed by Vertex\u2019s decision not to price Orkambi fairly following the guidance published by NICE two years ago, and by their more recent decision to unilaterally withdraw entirely from the NICE appraisal of Symkevi.   \r\n\r\nThe final offer NHS England made to Vertex in July this year provided significant commercial flexibilities designed to assist the company in obtaining positive NICE recommendations across all existing licensed treatments and future pipeline products, with the intention of making them rapidly available to patients and in advance of any NICE appraisals concluding. These flexibilities were to complement the NICE appraisal process, not act as a substitute for it.\r\n\r\nWe understand the frustration of the cystic fibrosis community, however, it has been made clear to Vertex that its drugs need to be priced responsibly and that any re-assessment of Orkambi's effectiveness must be carried out via NICE's established processes.  Vertex must now re-engage with the NICE appraisal process.  I am encouraged that they attended a meeting with NICE on 4th October and again on 30th November to discuss next steps and that there is a continuing dialogue between all parties.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

In order to inform any requests we make via the Spending Review, we are looking closely at how we fund providers to ensure the system supports sustainable, high quality education, and it will also be important to take account of the Review of Post -18 Education and Funding. \r\n\r\nAlthough we are not making an immediate increase in college funding levels we are planning to invest nearly \u00a37 billion this academic year to make sure there is a place in education or training, including for apprenticeships, for every 16- to 19-year-old. We have also protected the base rate of funding for 16-19 year olds until 2020. We will introduce our new gold standard T Levels from 2020, and will provide an additional \u00a3500m every year once they are fully rolled out.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have announced extra support for key priorities.

                    "details": "The Government shares the public\u2019s high regard for animal welfare and the welfare of our farmed livestock is protected by comprehensive and robust legislation. This is backed up by statutory species specific welfare codes, which encourage high standards of husbandry and which keepers are required by law to have access to and be familiar with.  Defra\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Agency inspectors and local authorities conduct inspections on farms to check that the animal welfare standards are being met. \r\n\r\nWe have already banned cages or close confinement systems where there is clear scientific evidence that they are detrimental to animal health and welfare. For example, the keeping of sows in close confinement stalls was banned in the UK in 1999, whereas it was not until 2013 that a partial ban on sow stalls was introduced across the rest of the EU. Whatever the system of production, the most important factor in determining animal welfare is good stockmanship and the correct application of husbandry standards. This reflects the advice of our expert body, the Farm Animal Welfare Committee. \r\n\r\nSince the 2012 EU ban on the use of conventional (\u201cbattery\u201d) cages for laying hens, hens are kept in either free range, enriched cages, barn or organic systems. Over half of UK egg production is free range, higher than any other country in the EU.  Enriched cages provide more space for the birds to move around than conventional cages and are legally required to provide nest boxes, litter, perches, and claw shortening devices which allow the birds to carry out a greater range of natural behaviours. Pullets (young hens) which will be housed in an enriched cage system as adults are reared in enriched cages, to ensure that the two environments are matched as far as possible to reduce stress and the likelihood of injurious pecking. In the UK, the use of cages to house both layer breeders and broiler (meat chicken) breeders is prohibited under the UK\u2019s farm assurance scheme standards. \r\n\r\nThe UK has a very small industry producing rabbits commercially for meat which uses free range systems, not cages. \r\n\r\nThe statutory welfare code for gamebirds states that barren raised cages for breeding pheasants and small barren cages for breeding partridges should not be used. Guinea fowl are not kept in cages. \r\n\r\nThe UK is ahead of most other EU pig producing countries in terms of non-confinement farrowing, with approximately 60% of UK sows in farrowing crates to give birth, and the remaining 40% housed outside and free farrowed (crate-free). Research is on-going to develop and test indoor free farrowing systems under commercial conditions which protect the welfare of the sow, as well as her piglets. \r\n\r\nThe UK unilaterally banned the keeping of calves in veal crates in 1990, sixteen years before the rest of the EU. However, as young calves are highly susceptible to disease, up to 8 weeks of age, they are permitted to be kept in individual hutches of a specified size with bedding provided, as long as they have visual and tactile contact with other calves.\r\n\r\nThe Government will maintain its high regulatory baseline and look to raise standards sustainably over time as new research and evidence emerges. We have been very clear that EU Exit will not lead to a lowering of our high animal welfare standards. Our regulatory system will offer the same level of assurance of animal welfare following EU Exit as it does now and we are actively exploring options for strengthening the UK system moving forward. This includes plans to increase maximum penalties for animal cruelty from six months\u2019 to five years\u2019 imprisonment.  \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\r\n",

There has never been any question that this Government\u2019s policies on animal welfare are driven by the fact that animals are sentient beings. We will make any necessary changes required to UK law in a rigorous and comprehensive way to ensure animal sentience is recognised after we leave the EU.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s view is that the current protections provided by Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) have not delivered the progress we want to see and that once we have left the EU we can do better. Article 13 only applies to a limited number of EU policy areas, provides some wide-ranging exemptions and most importantly, there is little scope for the duty to be enforced. As such, it has not prevented some practices in EU member states, which we would consider cruel and painful to animals.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the Government will ensure that animal sentience is not only recognised in domestic law, but that we will have an effective and proportionate means of taking animal sentience into account in policy making. \r\n\r\nHere in the UK, we are already improving animal welfare standards without EU input and beyond the scope of Article 13. The Government is committed to taking action to improve animal welfare at home and abroad, including by increasing maximum sentences for animal cruelty, banning third party sales of puppies, and introducing one of the world\u2019s toughest bans on ivory sales. We have also made CCTV mandatory in slaughterhouses and we are planning other reforms. These steps show how seriously this Government gives regard to animal welfare. \r\n\r\nAs we move towards a new relationship with Europe and the rest of the world, we have a unique opportunity to shape future animal welfare policy in the UK to ensure our already high animal welfare standards are maintained and enhanced.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.",

                    "details": "The invasive alien species of grey squirrel has almost eradicated the native red squirrel. The Government is determined to protect the highly threatened red squirrel, with the control of grey squirrel being part of this strategy. Actions relating to grey squirrels will not be made exempt from the provisions of the planned Invasive Alien Species (Enforcement and Permitting) Order 2019. We must ensure that the way we manage non-native species, such as the grey squirrel, is consistent with the EU Invasive Alien Species Regulation 2014, to support our own government strategy to reduce the impact of such species on highly threatened species, like the red squirrel. The EU Regulation does not allow for a general exemption for grey squirrels.\r\n  \r\nLegally, there is no need to end the life of any grey squirrel that has been taken to a rescue centre. In fact, in some circumstances, grey squirrels taken to rescue centres may be kept until the end of their natural lives. Non-commercial owners (such as people keeping animals as pets) may continue to keep grey squirrels in captivity as companion animals, as long as they were kept as a companion animal prior to the species\u2019 inclusion on list of species of Union concern (3 August 2016 for grey squirrel). \r\n\r\n In addition, there is a requirement, under Article 19 of the EU Regulation, to establish management measures for widespread species, aimed at their \u201ceradication, population control or containment\u201d. It is possible for some, otherwise prohibited, activities to be allowed as part of a species\u2019 management measures, provided there is strict justification and provided that all appropriate controls are in place.\r\nThe Order puts in place a licensing regime to implement management measures. Grey squirrels, such as those taken to rescue centres may be able to be kept under a management measure licence until the end of their natural lives. In situations where animals are being kept, either as a companion animal or under licence, they must be kept in secure containment and prevented from breeding or escaping. \r\n\r\nRelease into the environment of grey squirrels is not permitted, except as part of a specific activity aimed at supporting the control of the species, such as part of field trials for population control activity.\r\n\r\nWe will be providing further advice. This will give guidance on situations which may be covered by a defence, permit or licence and the route for applying for permits and licences under the Order. \r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

The Government has been approaching these meetings in a constructive spirit.  If these meetings yield ideas that are genuinely negotiable and have sufficient support in Parliament, the Government will then explore them with the EU.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the backstop, both the UK and EU are committed to avoiding the backstop ever coming into force. A letter of assurance from the EU to the Prime Minister also reaffirmed that the backstop would only ever be used for a short time if it did come into force. \r\n\r\nWhile the Government does not want a no deal scenario we are accelerating no deal preparations to ensure the country is prepared for every eventuality.  Given the significant disruption and impact on the economy that a no deal exit could create, this is the responsible thing to do.

                    "summary": "The Government takes these crimes very seriously. There are robust penalties in law to deal with theft and we are supporting the police to explore what more can be done to tackle stolen goods markets.",
                    "details": "The Government understands the distress and disruption that this type of crime causes and the effect it has on victims, including the impact on people who rely on the tools of their trade to earn a living.  \r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that these crimes, when they take place, should be reported to the police, so that they can be investigated and, where appropriate, the perpetrators taken through the courts and given appropriate sentences.  It is, however, for Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners, as operational leaders and elected local representatives, to decide how best to deploy resources to manage and respond to individual crimes and local crime priorities. \r\n\r\nThe Theft Act 1968 provides a maximum penalty of seven years\u2019 imprisonment for this type of offence.  In addition, the Act provides sufficient powers to tackle the threat of people going equipped to steal, with maximum penalties of three years\u2019 imprisonment available.  \r\n\r\nOf course, in each case sentencing is a matter for our independent courts.  When deciding what sentence to impose, the courts will take into account the circumstances of the offence and any mitigating and aggravating factors, in line with sentencing guidelines which are issued by the independent Sentencing Council.  As outlined in the definitive guideline on Theft, consequential financial harm and the impact of theft on a business are factors which will be taken into consideration by the courts when assessing the harm suffered by the victim or others.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure the courts are made aware of the full impact these crimes can have on victims, individuals can provide a Victim Personal Statement to set out the physical, emotional, psychological, financial or other impact a crime has on them.  Similarly, businesses can provide an Impact Statement for Business to set out impacts such as operational disruption, loss of custom and reputational damage.   Further information about these impact statements can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/victim-personal-statement.\r\n\r\nMaking stolen goods harder to sell on is a key part of making theft less attractive to thieves.  The Home Office is therefore supporting the police in exploring what more can be done to tackle the markets for stolen goods.  The first phase of this work has involved the Home Office working with the police, retailers, trade associations, insurers and others to understand better the buying and selling journey for a range of goods.  This phase of the work is now complete, and will inform police decisions on next steps, which include: establishing whether there is a need to strengthen identity and due diligence checks undertaken by the police, traders or members of the public; raising awareness of how traders and the public can further protect themselves from inadvertently buying and selling stolen goods; and whether these are actions that need to be driven locally by individual Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners, or nationally.\r\n\r\nThis work will build on current police activity, which includes working with key partners such as product manufacturers, security companies and representatives from the insurance industry to make goods \u2018harder to steal, harder to sell\u2019; and encouraging the public to mark and register their property.  Indeed, police forces have funded the provision of over half a million property marking kits to households across England and Wales, which has helped to bring those who steal or handle stolen property to be brought to justice.  Details of some of these property marking schemes can be found on police force websites, or by contacting the police locally.\r\n\r\nThe Government will consider the evidence on what more needs to be done to prevent van theft.  The Government supported a multi-agency approach to tackle crimes that involve the use of motorcycles, mopeds or scooters, commonly referred to as \u2018moped crime\u2019.  Moped crime is a complex issue, with several underlying drivers, and we were determined to ensure that everything was being done to support police efforts to tackle this threat.  We therefore brought the police, industry and others together to see what more could be done to prevent offending and keep the public safe.  As announced by the Minister of State for Policing and the Fire Service on 16 October, the Government will be taking a similar multi-agency approach to see what more can be done to take real, effective and preventive action to tackle thefts of all vehicles across the country. \r\n\r\nHome Office",

                    "summary": "The Trust with NHS support is making every effort to avoid overnight closure of Telford\u2019s A&E, but has plans in place if it is unavoidable. This is a temporary measure, to safeguard patients\u2019 safety. ",
                    "details": "On 27 September 2018 the Board of Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust made a decision that, if relevant medical and nursing staffing could not be improved in the short-term, it would temporarily suspend on patient safety grounds the overnight A&E services provided by the Emergency Department at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford. \r\n\r\nThis decision was taken by the Board in light of concerns that there are currently insufficient medical and nursing staff to ensure safe overnight A&E services for patients at the Princess Royal Hospital. To keep both Emergency Departments at the Trust open in the short-term and thus avoid the temporary overnight closure of the Princess Royal Hospital\u2019s Emergency Department, the Trust has advised that it needs an absolute minimum of at least 7 more Middle Grade Doctors and 15 more Registered A&E Nurses in order to ensure safe overnight A&E services for patients at the Princess Royal Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe Trust has, with the support of NHS Improvement and local partners, made significant recruitment efforts, including overseas recruitment, in support of its A&E services and continues to do so, although it has been currently unable to recruit sufficient staff to address the A&E staffing issues at the Princess Royal Hospital\u2019s Emergency Department. The Trust is also engaging with key local stakeholders, such as MPs and councillors, as part of this work. \r\n\r\nAlthough every effort is being made by the Trust and its partners in the local health system to avoid the overnight closure, including engagement with neighbouring Trusts to explore all options for securing additional staff, it is unlikely that other local Trusts will be in a position to provide sufficient staff to resolve the A&E staffing issues at the Princess Royal Hospital in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nThe Trust has advised that should the temporary overnight closure become unavoidable after it has explored all options, it would not happen until some time in November 2018 and would likely last for at least 6 months, with any re-opening decision by the Board depending on whether the Emergency Department would be able to provide safe services to patients. Relevant partners in the system, including the West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, have been engaging with the Trust to refine the details of potential closure plans, and the West Midlands Clinical Senate will also undertake a review of the options to ensure that patient safety is prioritised and that proposals fit with national guidance. \r\n\r\nThe Trust is also reviewing its business continuity arrangements to ensure that there is as minimal impact on patients as possible in the event of an overnight closure, and is also exploring options for patients in need of urgent rather than emergency care out of hours. \r\n\r\nIf the closure becomes unavoidable to ensure patient safety, the Trust has advised that this would mean that:\r\nthe Princess Royal Hospital\u2019s Emergency Department would be closed overnight between 20:00 and 08:00;\r\nthe Princess Royal Hospital\u2019s Emergency Department would be closed to ambulance admissions at 20:00 and ambulances would be diverted to neighbouring Trusts;\r\nthe Urgent Care Centre would accept patients until 20:00;\r\nthe Princess Royal Hospital would continue to accept GP-referred admissions in those specialities managed at the site between 08:00 and 20:00, 7 days a week; and\r\nstroke patients arriving by ambulance would be admitted via a direct pathway to the appropriate clinical ward.\r\n\r\nIn the event of the closure becoming unavoidable, the Trust will be putting in place a communications programme for the benefit of the public, staff and other stakeholders once a final overnight suspension management plan has been agreed.\r\n\r\nMinisters at the Department of Health and Social Care have also taken a keen interest in efforts to support the Trust, and have engaged with NHS Improvement and relevant stakeholders as part of this. It is important to note, however, that it is in the best interests of the local NHS and patients for decisions such as this one to be made locally, and for the NHS locally to keep the situation under review to ensure patient safety. \r\n\r\nIf local councillors or MPs have any concerns about the decision-making process, they should pass these on to the local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group or health scrutiny committee who can, in turn, request an independent review from the Independent Reconfiguration Panel. \r\n\r\nUntil the closure takes effect in the event of it being deemed unavoidable, the Trust has advised that A&E services at the Princess Royal Hospital will continue as normal, with the Emergency Department remaining open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

                    "details": "People with learning disabilities and autism deserve the very best support and care to have the same opportunities to live full and rewarding lives as everyone else.\r\n\r\nIn times of the most acute need, we want people with a learning disability and/or autism to be able to access high quality support in the community, close to home.\r\n\r\nBut recent reports have shown that for some children, young people and adults with a learning disability and/or autism who display behaviour that is considered challenging we remain too reliant on in-patient care in these circumstances. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, where people are admitted they can spend too long in hospital before appropriate support is available for them to be discharged causing distress to the individual and to their families. \r\n\r\nWe acknowledge this and we remain committed to supporting people with learning disabilities and/or autism to live in the community, to ensure that they are only admitted to hospital when absolutely necessary, and to ensure that if they are admitted they can leave as soon as their treatment has finished.\r\n\r\nWhilst some people will need access to time limited inpatient services for assessment of their needs and treatment, as appropriate, we have been clear that this should be as close to home as possible, for as short a time as possible, and with discharge plans put in place. The national plan and the service model which we are putting into place to support this was set out in Building the Right Support, published in 2015. Building the Right Support envisages that there would need to be some inpatient capacity but that the amount required would be significantly reduced.\r\n\r\nThrough the Transforming Care Programme, we are supporting both the discharge of people with learning disabilities and/or autism from mental health hospitals into the community with appropriate support and the development of community services to prevent admissions in the first place.  Since March 2015, we have reduced the number of people with a learning disability and/or autism in mental health inpatient settings by nearly 20%. The number of inpatients at the end of October 2018 was 2,350 and NHS England and local government continue to invest significant funding to develop community services and further reduce inpatient numbers. We are committed to achieving a reduction of at least 35% and to go as far beyond this as possible in line with the Building the Right Support planning assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Long Term Plan is expected to set out the next steps for the development of community support and achieving the Building the Right Support vision beyond March 2019. \r\n\r\nWe are very clear that any kind of restrictive practices, including seclusion, should only ever be used as a last resort and the intervention should always represent the least restrictive option to meet the immediate need. We will continue working to reduce the use of restrictive interventions and improve patient safety through improved monitoring and training across health and care services.\r\n\r\nWe remain deeply concerned about the misuse of such practices and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has asked the Care Quality Commission to undertake a thematic review into the use of restraint, the practice of prolonged seclusion and long-term segregation for children and adults with a mental illness, learning disability or autism in secondary care and social care settings and to make recommendations. This will help us to eliminate inappropriate restrictive practices and ensure that vulnerable people supported by health and social care are provided with dignified and compassionate care. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

This includes pharmaceutical companies stockpiling an additional six weeks\u2019 supply and prioritisation of medicines and medical products at the border.\r\n\r\nAs part of our no deal preparations, we are also increasing the capacity \u2013 the number of ships and routes \u2013 between ports in the UK and the European continent.  Before any contract was signed, due diligence on Seaborne Freight was carried out both by senior officials at the Department for Transport, and highly reputable independent third-party organisations with significant experience and expertise into Seaborne Freight\u2019s  financial, technical and legal underpinning.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Defence has been conducting contingency planning for a No Deal EU Exit, as announced in December. As part of this, the Ministry of Defence has taken the step of putting 3,500 regular and reserve personnel on standby to be able to support the Ministry of Defence as well as other departments. As part of the \u2018Whole Force\u2019 concept enshrined in UK defence doctrine, the use of reservists is considered for all Defence deployments, so this \u2018Call Out\u2019 is not unusual. The MoD routinely issues Call Out Orders to enable the use of Reservists for both domestic and overseas operations, such as for the London 2012 Olympics.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s policy is to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. We are committed to honouring the result of the referendum. To do otherwise would be to undermine the decision of the British people.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union.",

                    "details": "The Government understands that the cost of holidays can be higher outside of term time and we acknowledge that family holidays can be an enriching experience. The school year is designed to allow families numerous opportunities to enjoy their holiday without disrupting a child\u2019s education.  The Government does not set term and holiday dates. If parents and schools want different term dates, so they can take their children on holiday outside of the more expensive peak holiday season, they should discuss this with their local authority.\r\n\r\nThe Government has no powers to direct the commercial policy of the travel industry. In a competitive market it is for business to decide the market worth of their products and to price accordingly\r\n\r\nIt is a priority to reduce overall school absence as part of the Government\u2019s ambition to create a world-class education system. Our evidence (\u2018Absence and attainment at key stages 2 and 4: 2013 to 2014\u2019) shows that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil\u2019s chances of achieving good GCSEs, which has a lasting effect on their life chances. An absent pupil is also liable to interrupt the education of other pupils and increase teachers' workload in ensuring absent pupils catch up with missed work. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Government amended legislation to make it clear that leave of absence could be authorised by headteachers of maintained schools only in exceptional circumstances. The Department does not specify what constitutes exceptional circumstances; head teachers know their pupils best and are best placed to make judgements on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nParents have a duty, under section 7 of the Education Act 1996, to ensure their child of compulsory school age (5-16) receives an efficient full-time education, either by attendance at school or otherwise. If parents choose to register their child of compulsory school age at school, the law places a duty on them to ensure their child attends school regularly. \r\n\r\nWhere a headteacher has declined a request for leave of absence a parent should not take their child out of school. Taking a child out of school without the headteacher\u2019s permission can lead to parents being issued a penalty notice or prosecuted unless a statutory exception applies.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

This is why train operating companies want to move to this method of operation.  \r\n\r\nDCO allows staff to look after passengers rather than just operating the doors. Supporting disabled people to access the rail network is what we are committed to doing.  In July this year we published the Inclusive Transport Strategy, which is the next step in our ambition to deliver accessible transport. We want to make the transport system inclusive.

Anyone who requires treatment that a GP or healthcare professional regards as an emergency, or immediately necessary, should be provided with that treatment free of charge, regardless of whether they are registered with a GP or not.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for patients to register as a NHS patient with two GP practices at the same time as only one practice can hold a patient\u2019s medical records and there are potential clinical risks in maintaining duplicate records.  \r\n\r\nHowever, we recognise that students registered with a university GP practice may wish to access treatment from any GP when returning home or when away from their university practice.  In such circumstances, students can apply to a GP to be accepted as a temporary resident.  Temporary residence applies where a person intends to be in an area for more than 24 hours but for less than 3 months.  Once registered, patients can receive treatment in the same way as other registered patients.  Details of the patient\u2019s treatment provided, whilst a temporary resident, will be passed to their registered practice.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Long Term plan commits to providing access to online consultation for all patients and that by 2023/24 every patient in England will be able to access a digital GP offer. This would usually be from their own practice or, if they prefer, from one of the new \u2018digital first\u2019 GP providers. As part of the General Practice Forward View, a \u00a345 million fund has been created to contribute towards the costs for practices to purchase online consultation systems, improving access and making best use of clinicians\u2019 time. The evolution of services such as video consultations is likely to increase access options for patients, in particular those moving between addresses. It is, of course, important that any apps providing video consultations are evaluated and regulated to ensure that patients who access these services can be confident that they will receive safe, effective, high quality care.\r\n \r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",

                    "details": "The Good Work Plan was published in December 2018, setting out the Government\u2019s vision for the future of the labour market. This is the largest upgrade in workers\u2019 rights in over a generation and is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK. As part of this we will bring forward legislation to introduce a right for all workers, including those on zero hours contracts, to request a more predictable and stable contract. Those who are content to work varied hours each week will be able to continue doing so. However, those who would like more certainty will be able to request a more fixed working pattern from their employer after 26 weeks of service. This right will be available to both employees and workers and will provide them with greater control over their own lives.  The Government has also laid secondary legislation to repeal the Swedish derogation \u2013 a particular use of pay-between-assignment contracts which allow business an opt-out from equal pay requirements for agency workers.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognised the concerns over zero hours contracts and commissioned independent research from the Low Pay Commission. The independent research showed that zero hours contracts can be beneficial for the labour market as they allow flexibility for both employers and individuals. However, we recognise concerns around insecure work and the Government is committed to addressing the instances where some employers unfairly transfer risk to workers. Following the advice from the Low Pay Commission, we will be consulting on further proposals to address this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have introduced wide ranging reforms to support working families, going beyond EU minimum labour market standards. Fathers and partners now have a statutory right to Paternity Leave and Pay. Eligible parents can also take shared parental leave and pay, allowing them to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay after childbirth or adoption.  Most recently we have launched proposals to tackle pregnancy and maternity discrimination.  The Government is currently consulting on extending redundancy protection for women and new parents for up to six months after they return to work and on affording the same protections to parents returning from adoption leave or shared parental leave.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to ensuring that individuals are not unlawfully discriminated against because of any of the nine protected characteristics in the Equality Act 2010. These include both sex and pregnancy or maternity-related discrimination. The legislation not only implements the four EU equality Directives but extends the rights and protections to prohibit discrimination by providers of goods or services on grounds of age, disability, religion or belief, or sexual orientation.    \r\n\r\nThe Government is responsible for setting minimum pay thresholds and, through the National Living Wage (NLW) and National Minimum Wage (NMW), protects the lowest paid within our society. The introduction of the NLW delivered the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years. The Government has committed to increase the NLW to reach 60% of median earnings by 2020, subject to sustained economic growth. To meet this target, we will increase the NLW rate by 4.9% to \u00a38.21 in April 2019, so that a full-time worker on the NLW will be more than \u00a32750 better off over the course of the year compared to when the policy was introduced. This should benefit around 1.8 million workers directly. Furthermore, inflation-beating increases in the NMW rates are expected to benefit 350,000 young workers from April 2019.\r\n\r\nIn setting the NMW and NLW rates, the Government considers the expert and independent advice of the Low Pay Commission. We reward workers with the highest possible minimum wage while considering the wider impact on the economy and affordability for businesses. Setting the minimum wage rates too high or increasing it too quickly may lead to higher unemployment and harm the very people the policy is intended to help. We encourage businesses to pay more than the minimum where they can afford to do so, but we also recognise that this will vary across business and sectors. The Government has an aspiration to end low pay and later this year will set out the Low Pay Commission\u2019s remit for the years beyond 2020. \r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to not rolling back workers rights as we leave the EU.  We will enhance workers rights where it is the right decision for the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy",

                    "details": "It is not a case of choosing between international development and priorities at home. Poverty reduction is at the heart of what we do but UK aid is also tackling global challenges like disease such as Ebola, terrorism and conflict, creating a safer, healthier and more prosperous world. When we invest in stability, jobs, and sound governance, we address the root causes of problems that affect us at home too. Countries in poverty and conflict are not good for the UK; prosperous and stable countries are our trading partners of the future. Our aid commitment is a win for those we support and a win for the UK.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully exiting the EU will require us to be more, not less, outward-looking. Our commitment to invest 0.7 per cent of national income in aid contributes to the UK\u2019s global influence and our reputation as a development superpower. Our aid is a cross-government commitment that draws on the full range of the UK\u2019s skills and expertise. Through our world-class defence, diplomacy and leadership in international development, aid lifts millions of the world\u2019s poorest people out of poverty around the world at the same time as securing the UK\u2019s place in the world.\r\n\r\nWe know we must maximise the good we do with what money we have. This is why DFID seeks not just to spend money well but to show it could not be spent better \u2013 in the interest of those we are trying to help and with direct positive results for the UK too. DFID has introduced tough new reforms to deliver even better value for money, including clamping down on the risk of unethical practices by suppliers, holding aid organisations to account by tying funding to performance, closing programmes which fail to meet development objectives, and increasing efficiency savings.\r\n\r\nWe know UK aid works. To list just a few results achieved between April 2015 and March 2018, DFID has:\r\n-\tsupported 11.4 million children to gain a decent education; \r\n-\tsupported 40.3 million people to access clean water and/or better sanitation.\r\n-\tsupported 3.0 million people to raise their incomes or maintain/gain a better job or livelihood;\r\n-\tinstalled 182 Megawatts of clean energy capacity. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, UK aid is stabilising conflict zones where extremists could otherwise thrive. For example, DFID is supporting Iraq as it rebuilds following the conflict with Daesh, increasing political stability, security and prosperity in the region. This benefits both the Iraqi people and the UK. The UK is also leading the way in tackling illicit financial flows which enable global criminal gangs to operate. One UK aid project has supported African law enforcement officials to seize, confiscate or preserve over $76 million of illegal assets in 2017.\r\n\r\nAdvancing economic development in the world\u2019s poorest countries is also fundamental to the UK\u2019s international leadership. Investing in the growth of companies in Africa and South Asia creates the jobs and economic stability that lead to global security and help end aid dependency.\r\n\r\nLife-changing progress comes from growth that transforms economies; that creates productive jobs and private sector investment; and that spreads benefits and opportunities right across society. As we leave the EU we will build on our strong record as a champion of trade and development.\r\n\r\nWe aim to secure existing duty-free access to UK markets for the world\u2019s poorest and continue to support developing countries to reduce poverty through trade. Helping developing countries harness the formidable power of trade means we are not only creating trading partners of the future for UK businesses, but supporting jobs at home too. Building a more prosperous world and supporting our own long-term economic security is firmly in all our interests\u200e.\r\n\r\nUK scientists and cutting-edge technology are also at the forefront of global efforts, from developing new vaccines to wipe out disease to transforming the way we do development. Diagnostic tests for TB developed with UK aid are now being used by the NHS. The UK\u2019s Emergency Medical Team has gained skills in tackling diseases which now benefit their work in the UK. \r\n\r\nHowever, we must also recognise that UK aid alone is not going to deliver all we need to end extreme poverty by 2030. If we want to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, we have to let others help, including the private sector. We are working with the private sector and others to ensure we build economic opportunities in the markets we work in.\r\n\r\nWhere the UK considers the international aid rules to be outdated, we have led the way in pushing for reforms at the governing Development Assistance Committee (DAC). We have achieved important reforms including increasing the proportion of aid spending which contributes to peacekeeping missions and reducing restrictions to support countries affected by crises and natural disasters. We continue to challenge other nations to deliver on their commitments for a better and safer world.\r\n\r\nDepartment for International Development",

                    "details": "The Government believes residential leasehold law needs to be improved to make it fit for purpose. That is why we are committed to reforming the system, including prohibiting new residential long leases from being granted on houses, other than in exceptional circumstances, and restricting ground rents in newly established leases of houses and flats to a peppercorn.\r\n\r\nWe are also improving the experience of existing leaseholders, including on unfair fees and charges. The Government has set up a working group of housing experts chaired by Lord Best to look at raising standards across the entire property agent sector. This includes introducing mandatory qualifications for all property agents so home buyers, sellers, tenants, landlords and leaseholders can be confident they are getting a professional service and are being charged fairly. We will consider how fees such as service charges should be presented to consumers, the best means to challenge unjustified fees, and in what circumstances they should be capped on banned.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that some leaseholders hold leases which contain onerous terms, such as doubling ground rents, and we want to ensure they get the support they need. We are putting pressure on developers and freeholders to vary lease terms so that leaseholders get a fairer deal. This applies to leaseholders who own flats as well as houses. We are keeping a close eye on progress and will consider further action as needed.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also committed to reforming the home buying and selling process, so it is more efficient and less costly, by setting fixed time frames and maximum fees for the provision of leasehold information. We consulted on this proposal in Implementing reforms to the leasehold system in England which closed on 26 November, and is available at www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementing-reforms-to-the-leasehold-system. We will publish the Government response in due course.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Government is working with the Law Commission to support existing leaseholders \u2013 including making buying a freehold or extending a lease easier, faster, fairer and cheaper. On 20 September 2018, the Law Commission published its consultation paper on leasehold enfranchisement reform: Leasehold home ownership: buying your freehold or extending your lease. The provisional proposals would: \r\n\r\n- Provide a better deal for leaseholders by making enfranchisement easier, quicker and more cost effective.\r\n\r\n- Reform the existing rights of leaseholders, including removing the separate rules for houses and for flats.\r\n\r\n- Simplify, and reduce the legal and other costs of, the procedure for acquiring a freehold or an extended lease.\r\n\r\nDetails can be found at: www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/leasehold-enfranchisement/. The consultation closed on 7 January 2019, and the Law Commission will publish its report later this year.  \r\n \r\nThe Government wants to see commonhold flourish as it can offer real advantages as a viable alternative to leasehold. There is no diminishing interest in the property, allowing residents to own their flat in perpetuity. There is also no landlord, so commonhold owners have greater control of contracts and of their property. Finally, there is a commonality of interest among commonhold owners with no risk of forfeiture. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is generally accepted that reforms to commonhold legislation are needed to support roll out and take up of the tenure in the future. There are several reasons why commonhold has not flourished so far:\r\n\r\n- People do not know about it \u2013 not only consumers but some in the sector too. Some lenders have had a reluctance to lend on commonhold units, for example.\r\n\r\n- There have been difficulties converting existing leaseholds into commonholds.\r\n\r\n- There is a perception that commonhold is inflexible and unattractive to developers building large or complex developments.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Government is working closely with the Law Commission to reinvigorate commonhold. Their work will ensure that the legal structure is more responsive to the needs of home owners and developers. Our priority is to address the perceived shortcomings of commonhold so that developers, lenders and buyers all have confidence in the tenure.\r\n\r\nOn 10 December 2018, the Law Commission launched their consultation Reinvigorating commonhold: the alternative to leasehold ownership, which sets out a range of options to make remove barriers and encourage take-up. Further details on the consultation can be found on the Law Commission website at: www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/commonhold/. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Homes England are now willing for Help to Buy to support the purchase of commonhold homes.\r\n\r\nLeasehold can work in many circumstances as long as it is fair to leaseholders and transparent. Our reforms seek to achieve this, and we want to ensure everyone has the choice of tenure that meets their needs.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.",

We have also protected the base rate of funding for all 16 to 19 year old students until 2020 and our commitment to the sector has contributed to the current record high proportion of 16 and 17 year olds who are participating in education or apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nWe are currently delivering a major programme of skills reform and are transforming technical education through the introduction of new T Levels from 2020.  To support the delivery of these new qualifications we will be investing an additional \u00a3500m funding per year once the programme is fully rolled out.  We understand that not all providers will be delivering T Levels, however, this does represent a significant investment in our young people and in the 16 to 19 system.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are currently focusing on the introduction of T Levels and reforms to the apprenticeship system, this does not eclipse the crucial importance of the academic curriculum, or the key role FE and sixth form schools and colleges play in delivering this. Under the current funding arrangements, 16-19 institutions receive enough funding to deliver established study programmes including three A Levels.  Additional funding of over \u00a3500 million is available to provide extra support to disadvantaged students and students on large study programmes.  Extra funding was also announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget to support institutions to grow participation in level 3 maths, and the first of this funding will be included in 2019/20 allocations. \r\n\r\nWe are listening to the feedback we have received from the sector and are continuing to look carefully at post-16 education funding in preparation for the next Spending Review.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",

                    "details": "The Government has been working closely with the Local Government Association and representative bodies from across the parks, leisure and heritage sectors to develop innovative, creative and practical solutions to protect the long-term sustainability of our valued parks and green spaces.\r\n\r\nIt is a long-established policy of the Government that the funding provided to local authorities through the local government finance settlement is largely un-ringfenced. This provides authorities with the flexibility necessary to make spending decisions based on their intimate knowledge of local needs and priorities. From 2015 until 2020, councils have been able, and continue to be able, to access over \u00a3200 billion for local services. The Government believes that decisions about the allocation of resources from this budget \u2013 including to parks \u2013 should sit with local authorities as locally democratic, and directly accountable, bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Government has taken note of the proposal calling for the introduction of a legal duty for all green space to be managed to a good standard. However, we favour working collaboratively with local authorities within existing legislation to identity and share the best practice delivered at a local level. We also encourage new and pioneering models of funding and park management to preserve our existing green spaces.\r\n\r\nIn January 2018 the Government published the 25 Year Environment Plan which set out our commitment to protecting our green spaces. It also reflects the value we place on the management of good quality parks. As part of this, the Government is working in partnership with Natural England to draw up a national framework of green infrastructure standards. We consider \u2018green infrastructure\u2019 to include parks, playing fields, woodland, street trees, rights of way, allotments, canal towpaths, and green walls and roofs. It will also ensure that all new developments include accessible green spaces and that any area currently with little or no green space can be improved by its addition for the benefit of the whole community. We intend to publish these standards in 2019 and incorporate them into planning guidance so that councils can use them when making local planning decisions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in July of this year we published our revised planning rule book which can be found here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/740441/National_Planning_Policy_Framework_web_accessible_version.pdf\r\n\r\nThis sets out how new development should occur in the right places across the country. Alongside building the new homes this country needs, the Government is also committed to the creation, protection, enhancement and management of networks of biodiversity and green infrastructure. We will ensure this happens by: \r\nclearly setting out that a council\u2019s planning policies should include enough provision for the conservation and enhancement of green spaces; \r\nhighlighting the importance of green space in encouraging healthy lifestyles;\r\nmaking provision for communities to identify and protect green areas of particular importance to them\u202fthrough the designation of land as Local Green Space in local and neighbourhood plans can be found here: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-plans--2    https://www.gov.uk/guidance/neighbourhood-planning--2\r\n\r\nThis affords them a very high level of protection from redevelopment or inappropriate use.  \r\n\r\nIn 2015, the Government launched the Pocket Parks Programme and spent \u00a31.05m to create 86 new parks across England, many of which attracted match funding and local partnership support. We helped to create new and innovative green spaces in deprived areas providing access to green spaces and creating focal points for people to work together to build stronger communities.\r\n\r\nIn September 2017, the Government invested \u00a3500,000 to support the development of initiatives to identify solutions to issues faced by some parks. We created the Parks Action Group comprising of experts from across the parks, heritage and leisure sector to help drive forward this work. The group has been working collaboratively across key priorities including:\r\nexploring innovative models for funding parks and green spaces;\r\nassessing quality standards and sharing good practice;\r\nidentifying a shared vision for the future of parks; \r\nempowering local communities to get more involved.\r\n\r\nWorking with the sector, we are currently developing a programme of work aimed at transforming the way in which parks are developed, managed and sustained. We expect to announce our progress on this in early 2019.\r\n\r\nLast month the Secretary of State announced \u00a31 million to fund the creation of new pocket parks. This new round of funding will build upon the success of the first Pocket Parks programme and provide financial support for new parks and will also help renovate and restore some existing parks and children\u2019s playgrounds. We will shortly announce the details of this new project.\r\n\r\nOur parks and green spaces foster health, well-being, integration, and social engagement. We are committed to working collaboratively with local authorities, charities and community groups to support the long-term sustainability of our parks.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government",

                    "details": "In September 2017 the Government published the National Shipbuilding Strategy, which sets out how the Government plans to procure naval ships. For the purposes of procurement, the Strategy divides naval ships into \u2018warships\u2019 and \u2018other naval ships\u2019. Warships are defined, on the basis of their complex design, weapon systems and sensors, as frigates, destroyers and aircraft carriers. The nation needs to be able to design, build and maintain ships of these types in Britain so that, in time of war, we are not reliant on any other nation to carry out these activities on our behalf. In this way we protect our National Security. Ships of these types are built only in Britain. We do not build them abroad. \r\n \r\nOther types of naval ship have less complex weapons and sensors and do not have the same design features as warships. So long as the nation maintains its ability to design, build and maintain warships, we will also have the ability design, build and maintain other, less complex naval ships, such as the Fleet Solid Support vessels. The National Shipbuilding Strategy therefore laid down that other naval ships would be procured through open international competition.\r\n\r\nAs non-warships, the Fleet Solid Support ships are being procured through international competition. We do not consider there to be a national security interest which requires the design and construction of Fleet Solid Support ships to be limited to UK companies. This approach is mandated by UK procurement law which requires that all government procurement is conducted through fair and open international competition. \r\n\r\nThe procurement of the Fleet Solid Support ships under the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations (DSPCR) 2011, which transpose EU procurement regulations into UK law, is therefore consistent with UK law.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Defence's commitment to open international competition remains the cornerstone of defence procurement policy as the means by which we attract the best solutions and maximise value for money for UK taxpayers. We are clear that the Fleet Solid Support ships are Naval Auxiliary Support ships and not warships. The primary role of the Fleet Solid Support ships is the replenishment of naval vessels with bulk stores. They are non-combatant Naval Auxiliary Support Ships that are manned by civilian Royal Fleet Auxiliary crews and fitted with weapon systems solely for self-defence. \r\n\r\nThe commercial competition to procure the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fleet Solid Support ships is currently on-going and no decisions have been made on where the ships will be built. We do not believe UK shipbuilders will be at a disadvantage from foreign bidders. Fleet Solid Support bids will not be assessed solely on price. Any sensitive elements of Fleet Solid Support ships will be limited to a UK-only competition and the procurement strategy takes that fully into account. Shipyards around the UK have been positive about the opportunity the Fleet Solid Support programme represents, and a consortium of UK shipbuilders is bidding to build the ships.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence.",

This reduction took effect in two stages. An initial 15% reduction commenced on 1 November 2018, with a further 12.5% reduction coming into effect in January 2019. This represents a total reduction of 27.5%.\r\n\r\nThe reduction that has been implemented reflects the work MLAs have been doing in the current period and is in line with the recommendations of the Reaney report. \r\n\r\nThe Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act introduced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has created a period until 26 March where an Executive can legally be formed at any time - and the Secretary of State is focused on using the remainder of this period to work towards resumption of devolution. Our aim continues to be to re-establish a locally elected, democratically accountable devolved government as soon as possible so that decisions affecting the people of Northern Ireland are taken by locally elected ministers.\r\n\r\nThe people of Northern Ireland have already voted for a power-sharing Executive. What we now need is a period in which the requisite work and dialogue can take place between the political parties in Northern Ireland for an Executive to form.\r\nIn the event of further delay the Secretary of State will consider further reductions to MLA pay. \r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland Office.",

We have put in place a combination of policies and legislation to give effect to the UN human rights treaties that the United Kingdom has ratified, including CEDAW. \r\n\r\nWomen and girls\u2019 rights under CEDAW are largely reflected in existing domestic legislation, such as the Equality Act 2010 and the Human Rights Act 1998. As such, we do not agree that domestic legislation needs to incorporate all the provisions of CEDAW. Moreover, were we to do this within the scope of the Equality Act 2010, it would create a hierarchy of rights in terms of sex as compared to other protected characteristics where the equivalent of CEDAW does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe UK acceded to the Optional Protocol to CEDAW on 17 December 2004. The Protocol recognises the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to receive and consider complaints from individuals or groups within its jurisdiction. It also creates an inquiry procedure enabling the Committee to initiate inquiries into situations of grave or systematic violations of women\u2019s rights. \r\n\r\nIt is clear there is an incredibly broad range of work still to be done. Building on the introduction of our world leading regulations which requires every large employer to publish their gender pay and bonus gaps every year, we will continue to step up our efforts to eliminate the gender pay gap entirely, which is central to growing our economy. \r\n\r\nWe want to have 33 per cent of all board and senior leadership positions, such as board directors, in the FTSE 350 are held by women by 2020 so that young women see women in leadership positions in every part of society.\r\nTo ensure we protect and support victims, recognise the life-long impact domestic abuse can have on children and make sure agencies respond to domestic abuse, we will publish a landmark draft Domestic Abuse Bill later in this parliamentary session.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to work on building a society where gender has no bearing on a person\u2019s pay or opportunity.\r\n\r\nGovernment Equalities Office\r\n",

                    "details": "During 2018, over 500 migrants attempted to travel to the UK on small vessels. Around 40% of those were either disrupted by French law enforcement or returned to France via French agencies.\r\n\r\n80% of attempts were made in the last three months of the year and, in response, the Home Secretary announced a major incident in order to protect the lives of those attempting the crossing, and also to protect the border.\r\n\r\nPart of the response was to build on the strong and collaborative relationship the UK has with France on this issue. Last year\u2019s Sandhurst Treaty, a bilateral agreement between the UK and France, reinforced the commitment of both sides to work together on border security issues. \r\n\r\nOn 24 January 2019, the Home Secretary and the French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner signed a joint action plan, which includes:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOver \u00a36 million (\u20ac7m) investment in new security equipment;\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIncreased CCTV coverage of beaches and ports, air surveillance and shared intelligence; and \r\n\r\n\u2022\tA mutual commitment to conduct returns as quickly as possible under international and domestic laws.\r\n\r\nIn regard to returns, it is the UK\u2019s obligation, under international law, to take those rescued at sea to the nearest safe port. It is also an established principle that those in need of protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. \r\n\r\nTherefore, if we establish that a migrant has first entered another EU Member State and either engaged with the asylum system there or resided in that country for over five months, we will seek to return them there in accordance with the Dublin III Regulation. \r\n\r\nTo date, the Government has returned a number of migrants who crossed the Channel in small boats to various EU Member States, and we continue to pursue further returns where appropriate. \r\n\r\nWe will be working to secure a comprehensive returns agreement with the EU that replaces our obligations under Dublin once we leave the EU.\r\n\r\nHome Office.\r\n",
