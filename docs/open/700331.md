# Seek to expel the USA from the UN using Article 6 of the UN Charter

### Background

We want the Government to invoke Article 6 to seek to expel the USA from the UN.

Article 6 of the charter allows for any member, including Security Council members, to be expelled for persistent violations of UN principles. Expulsion is decided by the General Assembly after a UNSC recommendation.
