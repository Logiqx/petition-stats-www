# Return the Parthenon Marbles via the establishment of a new independent body

### Background

This petition asks Parliament to set up a new body which would oversee the return of cultural objects from UK National museums when requested to do so by overseas governments and communities. This would work in the same way as the Spoliation Panel which returns items stolen in the Nazi era
