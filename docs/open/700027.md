# Maintain the £3 bus fare cap permanently

### Background

As of the budget, we think that working people on lower incomes or who live in rural communities will suffer as a consequence of the decision to raise the bus fare cap to £3. We think bus fares should be permanently capped at £3 after December 2025.
