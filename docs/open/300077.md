# Regulate wildlife food so it’s safer for our UK hedgehogs, mammals & birds

### Background

Wildlife food isn’t regulated. Anything can be in the food & sold to the public as suitable. But it could be harmful, of poor quality, even fatal or not nutritionally correct. We request a team be set up to agree on safe, nutritious food, specially designed for all our UK hedgehogs, mammals & birds.
