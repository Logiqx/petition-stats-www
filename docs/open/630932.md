# Remove LGBT content from the Relationships Education curriculum

### Background

We believe kids shouldn't learn about this at an early age. I am sure there are many parents who do not want their or other children taught about LGBT in primary school.

### Government Response

Primary schools are not required to teach LGBT content but can choose to teach it in an age-appropriate way.  The Department for Education has no plans to change its advice to schools on this subject.

RSHE is designed to give pupils the knowledge they need to lead happy, safe, and healthy lives and to foster respect for other people and for difference. 

The statutory guidance states that all pupils should receive teaching on LGBT content during their school years. Secondary schools should include LGBT content in their teaching. Primary schools are strongly encouraged and enabled, when teaching about different types of family, to include families with same sex parents. 

Through these subjects, children will be taught about the importance of respectful relationships and the different types of loving and healthy relationships that exist. This can be done in a way that respects everyone’s views.

All schools may teach about faith perspectives. In particular, schools with a religious character may teach the distinctive faith perspective on relationships, and balanced debate may take place about issues that are seen as contentious.

In addition, schools should ensure that parents know what will be taught and when, and clearly communicate the fact that parents have the right to request that their child be withdrawn from some or all of sex education delivered as part of statutory RSE. 

Schools should also ensure that, in developing their RSE policy, that  they engage parents and provide examples of the resources they plan to use in lessons. We also expect schools to respond positively where parents ask to see specific materials, for example by inviting parents into the school to view materials where Copyright Law prevents them from sharing it online. 
The Department for Education has no plans to change its advice to schools on this subject.
