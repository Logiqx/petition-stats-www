### Government Response

Powers enabling local authorities to introduce road user charging schemes are long-standing and remain an appropriate tool to deliver local transport objectives including air quality improvements. 

There are no plans to revoke the long-standing powers, set out in Part III of the Transport Act 2000, on local road user charging. These powers provide an important tool for local authorities to support the delivery of local transport objectives. The legislation sets out the basic elements that must be included in order to establish a charging scheme, and states that any net proceeds resulting from the scheme once operational costs are covered should be used to support the delivery of local transport plans. The legislation also requires that local authorities consult on road user charging schemes. The powers can be used to enable local authorities to tackle congestion and pollution as part of a local transport plan and deliver local transport priorities, which include, but are not limited to, delivering air quality outcomes.

These powers have been used by local authorities to enable the implementation of Clean Air Zones in a number of areas, with the objective of reducing nitrogen dioxide levels to within legal limits in the shortest time possible. We know that poor air quality is a major environmental risk to human health. There is clear evidence of a link between exposure to air pollution and mortality and morbidity. It is a particular threat to vulnerable groups, including the elderly, young children, and those suffering from chronic respiratory diseases and heart disease. Those living in city centres, and near busy roads, often on the lowest incomes, are most exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution.

Air pollution has reduced significantly since 2010 – emissions of nitrogen oxides have fallen by 32% and are at their lowest level since records began. But there is more to do which is why Government continues to take action to improve air quality and deliver cleaner transport.

The most immediate air quality challenge is tackling the problem of nitrogen dioxide concentrations around roads, the only statutory air quality limit that the UK is currently failing to meet. Transport creates around 70% of roadside nitrogen oxides and makes a significant contribution to particulate matter. Around 72% of road transport emissions of nitrogen oxides come from diesel cars and vans, with older vehicles contributing disproportionately more.

The 26 July 2017 UK Plan for Tackling Roadside Nitrogen Dioxide Concentrations (The NO2 Plan) outlines how councils with NO2 levels exceeding legal limits must develop and implement local plans to deliver legal levels of NO2 in the shortest time possible. This could be achieved through various interventions depending on local circumstances, which could include measures such as road layout or signalling changes, reduced speed limits, or installation of emission reduction technology in local buses.

The NO2 Plan identified charging Clean Air Zones (CAZs) are an effective means of delivering compliant levels of NO2 in the shortest time possible based on a national level assessment, and as such local authorities need to consider CAZs when developing local plans to understand their effectiveness and impacts at a local level. However, the NO2 Plan also recognises that given the impact of CAZs on individuals and businesses, when considering between equally effective alternatives to deliver compliance, the UK government believes that measures other than charging CAZs should be preferred. The government assesses all local plans to make sure they are effective, fair, good value and will deliver the required improvements in air quality in the shortest time possible.

In some instances, evidence produced by local authorities has indicated that CAZs are required in order to achieve the stated objective. As set out in legislation, any local authority proposing to implement a CAZ must carry out a statutory consultation. The CAZ Framework sets out the principles local authorities should follow when setting up CAZs, it is designed to provide a consistent approach to the introduction of CAZs. The Framework sets out the different classes of CAZ and the types of vehicle subject to a charge within each class. Where a local authority’s plan identifies a CAZ is needed, they should implement the minimum class of CAZ that will achieve legal NO2 limits in the shortest time possible  to minimise the impact of the zone on businesses and individuals in the area.

The Government’s work with local authorities to deliver legal levels of NO2 is  supported by £880 million of funding to help develop and implement local air quality plans and to support those impacted. Local authorities implementing air quality measures as part of a local plan can bid for Clean Air Fund (CAF) funding to support those impacted as a result of measures. The CAF supports a range of measures such as vehicle upgrade and retrofit schemes, improvements to bus fleets, installation of electric chargepoints, provision of park and ride services, concessionary travel schemes and freight consolidation centres. Local authorities themselves establish and deliver schemes under the CAF and set the eligibility criteria. The CAF is intended to mitigate the impact of a CAZ and should focus resources on those residents and businesses most affected by the measure. As of January 2022, the Government has awarded over £311 million of support from the Clean Air Fund.

Transport in London is devolved and the responsibility of the Mayor of London and Transport for London (TfL). The Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) in London is a road user charging scheme made under section 295 and Schedule 23 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, as amended. The ULEZ was introduced in London on April 8th 2019 and was expanded on 25 October 2021. According to TfL, it has contributed to a 44% reduction in roadside nitrogen dioxide within its boundaries and will help deliver wider benefits for the capital, including preventing more than one million air pollution related hospital admissions over the next 30 years, saving the NHS around £5bn.
