# Launch a railcard for those over the age of 30 covering all of the UK.

### Background

The Government should create a railcard for those over the age of 30. It seems unfair and unjust that people aged 16-30 may get a railcard, but after this cut-off it is not possible to get a railcard unless you are 'senior', travelling with another person, or part of another group, such as veterans.
