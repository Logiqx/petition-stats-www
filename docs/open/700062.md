# Fund Breast Cancer Screening from Age 40 & Alternative Screening Options

### Background

We urge the Government to fund breast cancer screening at 40+, as thousands under 50 are diagnosed yearly. Early screening can save lives and lessen the need for aggressive treatments. Invest in alternative screening, including options for dense breast tissue, to help ensure no one is overlooked.
