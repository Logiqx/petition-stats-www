# Recognise Palestine as a State and seek immediate ceasefire in Gaza 

### Background

We believe it is imperative the UK Government acknowledges the rights of all Palestinian people and seeks to implement an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Their suffering must end; they deserve basic human rights. Palestinians should live without fear and make decisions about their future.
