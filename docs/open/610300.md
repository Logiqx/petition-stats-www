### Government Response

Certain services do include provision for patients to receive energy cost rebates, but these are unique to specific conditions. Clinical Commissioning Groups are best placed to support their populace.

The Government understands that some households with a disability or medical condition have higher than average energy costs. NHS England provides electricity refunds for users of certain medical equipment in the home, such as oxygen concentrators. If a patient is prescribed an oxygen concentrator as part of their home oxygen therapy, the provider will reimburse the patient for any electricity the machine uses at the standard rate for the electricity provider in that region. Clinical Commissioning Groups are best placed to support their local populace.

The Government is aware of the impact that high global wholesale energy prices are having on all consumers.  Although Government does not determine the price of gas or electricity, these are set by global market conditions, the price cap ensures that the price of tariffs is fair and that customers do not experience a loyalty penalty.
 
Government has also put in place additional support worth £9.1bn on top of existing measures to support vulnerable households.

• Households in Great Britain will receive a £200 cash rebate on their energy costs this October. This will be delivered via energy suppliers, who must pass on the entire £200 saving to households, and will be clearly identifiable as a line item on bills.

• In addition, there has been a £150 non-repayable reduction in Council Tax bills for all households in Bands A-D in England and £144 million of discretionary funding for Local Authorities to support households who need support but are not eligible for the Council Tax reduction.
  
• Vulnerable consumers will also have protection through the extension of the Warm Home Discount Scheme, which provides over 2 million households with a £140 rebate off their energy bills (usually the electricity bill) each winter. The Warm Home Discount reforms will better target automatic rebates to fuel poor households on the lowest incomes. 
 
As set out in the British Energy Security Strategy, the Government will rebalance the costs placed on energy bills away from electricity to accelerate consumers and industry's shift away from volatile global commodity markets over the decade.  Proposals on how to do so will be published in 2022.
