# End 'other children a paying parent supports' deductions to Child Maintenance.

### Background

The CMS purports to exist to assist separated parents. Why then does it take financial support away from the child(ren) that are in need of it? Parentage is assumed if the 'paying parent' meets certain criteria - surely, then, these criteria should be applied when considering these deductions?
