# Require restaurants to show total prices, inclusive of service charges, in menus

### Background

Please prohibit restaurants from automatically adding service charges, typically 12.5%, on top of menu prices, as they cause a misleading indication of price and distort competition. Menus should show total prices that restaurants expect to be paid for each dish or drink including service charges.
