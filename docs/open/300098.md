# We call on DEFRA, to reinstate the ban on the use of metaldehyde slug pellets.

### Background

The government has conceded that its decision making process was flawed and has overturned the ban on metaldehyde slug pellets. We now call on the government to urgently follow the correct decision making process to ensure a ban on the use of metaldehyde pellets is put in place as soon as possible.
