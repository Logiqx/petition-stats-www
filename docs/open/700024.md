# Ban fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship

### Background

Advertisements encourage the use of products and sponsorship promotes a positive reputation & creates a social licence of trust & acceptability. In 2003 a ban on all tobacco advertising was introduced and has arguably worked. I believe continued fossil fuel usage will kill more people than smoking.
