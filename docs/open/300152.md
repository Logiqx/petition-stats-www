# Ban all single use plastic

### Background

I want there to be a ban on all single use plastic e.g. plastic packaging for fruit and veg, plastic bottles, plastic on cans of alcohol, plastic bags in supermarkets because half of these things end up in land fill sights, oceans and on land in places where animals inhabit.
