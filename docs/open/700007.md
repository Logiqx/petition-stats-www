# Require dating apps to ensure ID and DBS checks on users & ban violent offenders

### Background

I believe to better protect the public from offenders, the Government should legislate to require dating apps and websites to make it mandatory for users to undergo ID and DBS checks to open an account, and require them to implement permanent bans on users who have committed violent offences.
