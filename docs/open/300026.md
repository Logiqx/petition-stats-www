# Hold a referendum on the post-2020 UK-EU relationship with option to rejoin EU

### Background

In the general election on 12th December 2019, only a 47% minority of votes were for pro-Brexit parties. The democratic wish of the remaining 53% majority must be respected. Therefore hold a first-time referendum on the UK's post-2020 relationship with the EU, including an option to rejoin the EU.
