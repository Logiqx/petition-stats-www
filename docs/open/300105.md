# Introduce Mandatory Ethnicity Pay Gap Reporting

### Background

Much like the existing mandatory requirement for employers with 250 or more employees must publish their gender pay gap.  We call upon the government to introduce the ethnicity pay gap reporting. To shine a light on race / ethnicity based inequality in the workplace so that they can be addressed.
