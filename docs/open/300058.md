# New "UK Person" status for nationals of countries that prohibit dual nationality

### Background

The United States has a status of "US Person". Please create the new status of "UK Person" for those who already qualify for British citizenship but who cannot obtain it because their country of origin prohibits multiple nationalities. A "UK Person" would enjoy all the rights of British citizenship.
