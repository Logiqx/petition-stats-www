# Donate migrant boats to Ukraine

### Background

It seems that it costs the British taxpayer to store these boats and engines in Dover and at other facilities. Confiscated from people smugglers, we believe they should be repurposed by donating to the Ukrainian Military for use in defence and rescue missions on Dnipro and other Ukrainian rivers.
