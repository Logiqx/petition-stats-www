# Allow ALL vaccinated British Expats to visit the UK without quarantining

### Background

There are an estimated 5-6 million British Nationals living abroad as expatriates. Many countries with large British expat populations appear on the red travel list from 17 May. We propose the Government allow all vaccinated British expats to return home quarantine-free to visit their families.

### Government Response

Public health has always been our number one priority and we will not risk throwing away our hard-won achievements which have only been possible through the work of the British people.

We recognise the impact that restrictions and this pandemic have had on many people. We have made enormous progress this past year in tackling the pandemic across Britain. That progress has been hard won and it is important that we do not risk undermining it now. Yet we are also a nation with ties across the globe.

In 2019, UK residents took over 93 million trips abroad, for business, leisure and to visit friends and family. International travel is vital. It connects families who have been kept apart, boosts businesses and underpins the UK economy. It is absolutely essential that any steps we take now, lay the groundwork for a sustainable return to travel.

We have set out a pragmatic approach, protecting public health while also enabling international travel to restart again. Obviously, this is just the first step towards a future travel system. Measures will be formally reviewed on 28 June, 31 July and 1 October to take account of the domestic and international health picture and respond accordingly. 

Given that the virus is still spreading in many parts of the world, people should not be travelling to amber and red countries for leisure. 10-day managed hotel quarantine requirements will remain in place for those permitted to return to England from ‘red’ countries, and quarantine at home alongside stringent testing will be required for those returning from ‘amber’ destinations.

Countries have been allocated by ministers according to the latest scientific data, so quarantine and testing requirements on return from those countries are appropriate to the risk of coronavirus and variants of concern.

There are some instances where travellers might be able to get an exemption from needing to quarantine. These exemptions are exceptional and limited, and you will need evidence to support your request.

Vaccination status is considered in the risk assessment, but JBC is looking for the outcome of vaccination programmes, i.e. reduced levels of infection including variants of concern. Countries with high levels of vaccination but sustained high levels of infection would be of concern.

Even if you’ve been vaccinated, you still have to follow the same testing and isolation requirements as non-vaccinated people when you return to the country, as per the traffic light system. 

Recognising the strong strategic rationale and success of the vaccine programme, we have commenced work to consider the role of vaccinations in shaping a different set of health and testing measures for inbound travel. We will set out our position in due course.
