# Introduce a Long-Term Visit Visa for Parents of British Citizens and ILR Holders

### Background

We urge the UK Government to create a long-term visit visa for parents of British citizens & ILR holders. This visa would allow extended stays beyond the current six-month limit, with applicants providing proof of private health insurance or paying an NHS surcharge to mitigate public health costs.
