# Extend the 10-yr storage limit for eggs frozen for non-medical (social) reasons

### Background

The best time for a woman to freeze her eggs is in her 20s but under UK law women who do this for non-medical reasons can only store eggs for 10 yrs. If she doesn't use them in this time frame, she must: destroy her eggs, become a parent before being ready or transfer her eggs to a clinic overseas.
