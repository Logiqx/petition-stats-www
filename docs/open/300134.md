# The Legalisation of Euthanasia in the UK

### Background

Allow terminally ill individuals the choice of when they end their suffering. 

Of course, Euthanasia needs to be regulated, but allow the people to choose how or when they pass away. 

If an individual has a condition that will lead to a painful drawn out death give them the choice.
