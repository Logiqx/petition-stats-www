# Hold a referendum to scrap the UK's policy of Net Zero CO2 by 2050

### Background

We need a referendum - The Net Zero CO2 policy was waved through parliament without any meaningful debate, proper costings or cost benefit analysis. There was no party in the 2019 general election standing in all 650 seats that was against net zero to give voters the choice to vote against it.
