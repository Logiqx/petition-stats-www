# Negotiate a youth mobility scheme with the EU

### Background

We would like the Government to negotiate a youth mobility scheme with the EU. We believe this would expand opportunities for school children and young people to take trips, study, teach and volunteer abroad. We think this should include passport and visa free school trips.
