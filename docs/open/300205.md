# All halal and kosher certified products are to be prominently labelled as such.

### Background

It is strictly forbidden for some Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians to consume any halal or kosher certified product or religiously slaughtered meat. Without clear prominent labelling we could be consuming it without knowing. All we are asking for is clear labelling to make an informed choice.
