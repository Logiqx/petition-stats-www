# Legal rights for ancient trees

### Background

All ancient trees (over 100 years of age) to have the legal right not to be damaged or felled, with the exception of sustainable forestry to produce wood and maintaining the treeâ€™s health. This would effectively make tree preservation orders (TPOs) national.
