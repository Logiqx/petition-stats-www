# Lower the English language test exemption age for BNO visa holders from 65 to 60

### Background

We propose allowing individuals over 60 to provide proof of active participation in ESOL courses in place of a formal test when applying for settlement. This adjustment would offer more support to elderly BNO visa holders.
