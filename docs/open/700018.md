# Don't put an extra duty on vape products

### Background

We think that putting duty on vaping products of £2.20 per 10ml will lead to people smoking again. This is adding potentially £22 per 100ml liquid on top of the price. We think this is extremely excessive. We think it's an unfair duty on a product that contains no tobacco.
