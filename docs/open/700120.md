# Stop Means Testing Pensioners and increase the State Pension

### Background

We demand the government stop means testing pensioners, that we think is a degrading and humiliating practice. We also think the state pension should be increased.
We believe that for too long, our elderly have been portrayed by media as merely burdens on the NHS and the modern welfare state.
