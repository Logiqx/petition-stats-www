# Limit the sale and use of Fireworks to licence holders only

### Background

Fireworks killed our mum, Josephine Smith.
Her home was attacked using fireworks. We believe the use of fireworks after sale to the public cannot be policed.
We think all displays should be licensed and sales limited to licence holders only.
