# Do not reduce the Right to Buy discount

### Background

Stop the reduction of the Right to Buy discount. The Government have said the maximum discount will be reduced to £16,000–£38,000 depending on the tenant's location. We think this is unfair because some people's only way only to get on the housing ladder is via Right to Buy.
