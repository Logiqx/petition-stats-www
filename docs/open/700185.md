# Donâ€™t require health & care workers to update visa for additional work

### Background

If you are on a health and care visa and do 20+ hours of additional work for another employer, outside of your sponsored job, you have to apply to update your visa. We urge the Government to remove this requirement. It could help with critical staffing shortages and rising living costs.
