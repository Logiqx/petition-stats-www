# Commercial Pilot Training to be VAT exempt and introduce new funding options

### Background

I am urging the Government to make all commercial pilot training fees VAT exempt and provide government-backed loans or grants for aspiring pilots. I believe that this would lower financial barriers which in turn would promote diversity and provide a sustainable future for the aviation industry.
