# Run a public information campaign on the climate crisis 

### Background

Communicate clearly:
1) the science behind the climate crisis - how & why for the first time in the last year we've averaged 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels
2) the implications of going beyond this and what needs to be done to address it globally, nationally, locally and individually.
