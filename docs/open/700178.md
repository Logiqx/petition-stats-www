# Fund menopause support being added to the NHS Health Checks for women over 40

### Background

Taking place every five years from the age of 40, we think that NHS Health Checks are the perfect opportunity for the majority of women to see a healthcare professional before perimenopause starts to learn more about what to expect, and then again during and after menopause for continued care.
