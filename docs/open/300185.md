# Make it Law to Label Non-Religiously Slaughtered Meat Products.

### Background

The law states that Halal and Kosher meat must only be intended for Jews and Muslims. To make matters worse, the government does not force religiously slaughtered meat companies to so label this meat when it enters the general supply chain, due to higher costs.
