# Change approach to COV-19 - if schools have "confirmed" cases they should close.

### Background

The current advice from the Government is that no school should close in response to a suspected (or confirmed) COVID-19 case unless advised to do so by Public Health England.

I do not think this is correct advise, if "confirmed" schools should be closed for deep clean with pupils sent home.
