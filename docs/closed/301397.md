# Implement UK lockdown for preventing spread of COVID19

### Background

The UK needs to follow suit the containment procedures of countries that have been greatly affected by COVID19 such as Italy.

The UK should restrict unnecessary travel between towns and cities. Travel permitted should only be for work or emergencies. Public gatherings should also be discouraged.

### Government Response

We understand the public’s concern and are doing everything we can to combat the outbreak. We will continue to evolve our response based on the latest and best scientific and medical advice.

It is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the best evidence available. 

On 3 March, the Government launched its coronavirus (COVID-19) action plan: www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan/coronavirus-action-plan-a-guide-to-what-you-can-expect-across-the-uk. This plan has two overriding aims: to protect the NHS by building it up and flattening the curve of coronavirus cases; and to protect life by safe guarding those who are most vulnerable. 

Since this petition started the Government has made a number of significant announcements which are set out below. We will continue to adapt the response to follow the best scientific advice.

On 16 March Secretary of State for Health Matt Hancock announced a ‘Stay at Home’ policy. This is a social-distancing model for the general public with more home-working and less social interaction. 

Guidance on social distancing for everyone in the UK and protecting older people and vulnerable adults has been published on gov.uk: www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults.

This guidance is particularly important for people over 70 years old, pregnant women, and those with some health conditions. It advises on the social distancing measures we should all take to reduce our social interaction in order to reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19): 

Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous cough

Avoid non-essential use of public transport, varying your travel times to avoid rush hour, when possible

Work from home, where possible. Your employer should support you to do this. Please refer to employer guidance for more information

Avoid large gatherings, and gatherings in smaller public spaces such as pubs, cinemas, restaurants, theatres, bars, clubs

Avoid gatherings with friends and family. Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social media

Use telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential services

Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is pragmatic. 

The Government advises those who are at increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19) to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures. This group includes those who are: 

aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)

under 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (ie anyone instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds):

chronic (long-term) respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis 
chronic heart disease, such as heart failure 
chronic kidney disease
chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis 
chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), a learning disability or cerebral palsy
diabetes
problems with your spleen – for example, sickle cell disease or if you have had your spleen removed
a weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and AIDS, or medicines such as steroid tablets or chemotherapy 
being seriously overweight (a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above)
those who are pregnant

There are some clinical conditions which put people at even higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The NHS in England will directly contact those who are in this category. 

People falling into this group are those who may be at particular risk due to complex health problems such as:

people who have received an organ transplant and remain on ongoing immunosuppression medication

people with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy

people with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia who are at any stage of treatment

people with severe chest conditions such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma (requiring hospital admissions or courses of steroid tablets)

people with severe diseases of body systems, such as severe kidney disease (dialysis)

The Government will shortly start a ‘shielding’ approach for the 1.4 million most vulnerable people in our community. 

On 17 March the Foreign and Commonwealth updated their travel advice, advising against all non-essential international travel, initially for a period of 30 days. This reflects the pace at which other countries are either closing their borders or implementing restrictive measures. 

On 19 March the Government will introduce the Coronavirus Emergency Bill which will grant the power to keep essential services running. 

These measures will be disruptive, but the Government believes they will save lives.

Tackling coronavirus is a national effort: thank you for the part you are playing. 

Department of Health and Social Care.
